 Five suspects arrested in connection with the deadly Ngcobo police station attack in February are again expected in at the Magistrate's Court in Engcobo on Thursday for a formal bail hearing. Five police officers and a soldier lost their lives during that brazen attack on the Ngcobo police station in the early hours of Wednesday, 21 February. "Other charges that have been added against the suspect include among others attempted murder, house breaking, robbery and malicious damage to property," Hawks spokesperson, Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi, said then. At least 10 suspects were arrested for the attack following a shootout with the police at a local church. "Five of the suspects have since been released, however investigations into their involvement are still continuing."
