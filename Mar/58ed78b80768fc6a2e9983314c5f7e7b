 The Nelson Mandela Bay will be hosting its annual Splash Festival over the Easter weekend from the 30th of March till 02 April. While it usually happens over three days, the Municipality has decided to add one more day this year. Addressing the media at the launch of this year's festival, at the Hobie Beach Yacht Club, in Summerstrand, Port Elizabeth, Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality Executive Mayor, Athol Trollip, said that the 2018 Splash Festival will focus on water sports - hence, much of the family events, sports and enetertainment will be at the beach. Over 40 local artists with variable artistic contents, including music, visual arts, comedy and children’s entertainment are expected to attend this year's festival. National artists like Casspper Nyovest and Nokwazi are also expected to entertain crowds at the festival. The cry of Wells Estate, who use the St Georges Strand beach, was heard and this year's Splash Festival will be happening there. Trollip also took the opportunity to appeal to residents to help keep the beaches clean and ensure that the name of the great icon, the late former President, Nelson Mandela, who the City is named after, is always well-represented. “Our city is an iconic friendly ocean city; if we destroy the ocean then we will no longer be iconic. “We want to be a destination of choice world-wide," he said. “We have lifesaving championship. Family weekend, take care of the family while you are and leave the stuff that makes you mad at home don't bring it to the beach." The Mayor also urged residents to ensure full supervision of children and condemned the abuse of alcohol during such events. At the event, Municipal Resorts director, Kithi Ngesi, introduced a beach locker that he said would help keep people's valuables safe while they have fun at the beach.
