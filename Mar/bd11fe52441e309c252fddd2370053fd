"Please note: It is impossible to provide the exact street names, as some areas (such as Walmer, Gelvandale, Kabega and others) are fed from two different substations," he added. "Therefore, the Municipality is unable to determine the exact boundary due to the proximity of the circuits and the network topology (how the network is arranged.) Also, such topology can change at any time due to other factors, such as cable faults and loading problems. "As there is no guarantee that supply will be off throughout the whole period stated, installations in all premises must be regarded as being live during these hours." Mniki said that the Municipality wishes to apologise to residents and businesses for the inconvenience caused by this planned shutdown.
