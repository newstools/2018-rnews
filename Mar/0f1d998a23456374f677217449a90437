 The University of South Africa (UNISA) on Monday said that it has noted with concern a media statement issued by the South Africa Police Services (SAPS)’s Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (HAWKS) on Tuesday last week, under the heading: HAWKS CLAMP DOWN ON FRAUD SYNDICATE AT UNISA PRETORIA CAMPUS. "The heading of this statement was grossly misleading and created an impression of the existence of a fraud syndicate at UNISA. Indeed, it was subsequently covered as such by several media houses and equally created a lot of consternation from the UNISA student community, with many lambasting the university on social media platforms," the university said. "The university wishes to correct the wrong impression created by the HAWKS media statement and to place it on record that the arrest of the employee was in connection with an alleged crime committed at a different place of employment prior to her joining UNISA. "The HAWKS only concluded their investigations after she had already left the employment of the institution concerned; and only came to the Muckleneuk campus to effect an arrest." UNISA said that although the alleged crime was not committed at UNISA, the university nevertheless views this matter in a serious light; and has already directed that an investigation into her employment at UNISA be instituted, in particular to ascertain if the necessary disclosures were done upon the individual’s employment.
