 A teen from the Gauteng is recovering in a local hospital after nearly drowning at a beach in Jeffreys Bay on Sunday evening. According to Rieghard Jansen van Rensburg, National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) Jeffreys Bay station commander, at 18h06, on Sunday, the NSRI Jeffreys Bay duty crew were activated following reports of a drowning in progress at Albatros Beach, Jeffreys Bay. "Our sea rescue craft Eddie Beaumont II was in the area at the time on a routine exercise and they diverted to respond and our NSRI rescue vehicle and Private Care ambulance services responded," he said. "On our sea rescue craft arrival on the scene an 18 year old female was found in a rip current about 80 meters off-shore."  Jansen van Rensburg said that two NSRI rescue swimmers were deployed into the surf from the sea rescue craft. "They secured the teenager and she was recovered onto the sea rescue craft and brought to shore and taken into the care of paramedics. "During the rescue a male surfer paddled out to the scene to alert NSRI that another two people, a male bystander who had launched into the surf to assist but then got caught in rip currents himself, and a female who had appeared to also be caught in the same rip current with the female, who NSRI had rescued, that both that male and female reached the shore safely and they were not injured," he described. "The rescued teenager is from Benoni and she has been transported to hospital in a stable condition by ambulance, with her mom, for treatment for non-fatal drowning symptoms and she is expected to fully recover."
