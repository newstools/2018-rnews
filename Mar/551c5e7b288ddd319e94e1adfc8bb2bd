 The University of South Africa (UNISA) on Friday said that in the past few days allegations of sexual harassment and/or rape were made against an employee of the university by a staff member attached to the UNISA Centre for Early Childhood Education (UCECE) and started circulating on both social and mainstream media platforms. "The university has taken note of, and is gravely concerned and distressed about this incident. "We want to state categorically that UNISA has a zero tolerance towards all forms of harassment in the workplace and, where complaints of harassment are brought to its attention, they are fully investigated and pursued vigorously until they reach finality," said Spokesperson, Martin Ramotshela. "With regard to the specific matter raised above, the university is taking the requisite action after receiving the complaint and has, as a matter of procedure; already placed the two employees implicated in the matter on suspension as per policy. "The matter will receive close and urgent attention until it has been finalised." Ramotshela said that the university has also noted that the same matter has been reported to the South African Police Services (SAPS), who are conducting their own investigation. "The university undertakes to co-operate fully with the SAPS investigation. "At this point, we wish to appeal to all stakeholders to give these two processes a chance until finality is reached on both," he added. "Management further encourages any other employees and students experiencing incidents of harassment to report these matters to the right functionaries and through appropriate channels."
