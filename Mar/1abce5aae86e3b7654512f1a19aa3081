 Police detectives, inclusive of Provincial Organised Crime Investigation Unit and Hankey Detectives, made a breakthrough in the attack that happened at a residence outside Hankey just before midnight on Saturday. "On Sunday, at about 22:30, a 30-year-old was arrested in Hankey and linked to the attack," described police spokesperson, Captain Gerda Swart. "It is alleged that the suspect gained entry into the house after firing several shots through a glass door wounding a 44-year-old female in the process. "The suspect took the female in her vehicle to an ATM in town (Hankey) to withdraw cash. "Whilst the suspect was busy withdrawing cash, the victim managed to drive off with her car to another farm in the area and police were alerted." Captain Swart said that the suspect will appear in the Hankey Magistrate's Court on Tuesday on charges of house robbery, attempted murder, rape, pointing of firearm, assault with the intent to do grievous bodily harm, theft and abduction. "More charges could be added." The Humansdorp Cluster Commander, Brigadier John Lebok, commended the team for their commitment and dedication in effecting the arrest. “The detective team worked tirelessly following up information which led to the arrest. I am satisfied with the swift arrest because it is what is expected by the communities we serve and it will also send a strong message to would-be gender based criminals that we mean business and that we will bring to book those who choose to attack women and children. “We are also grateful to communities who come forward and provide the SAPS with information,” said Brigadier Lebok.
