 The case against controversial Nigerian televangelist and Senior Pastor of the Jesus Dominion International church, Tim Omotoso, is again expected in the Port Elizabeth Magistrate's Court on Thursday. Omotoso faces multiple charges relating to sexual exploitation and human trafficking. He is alleged to have sexually abused several young women at his church in Umhlanga, Durban, under the pretext of healing them. Charges of contravening immigration laws as well as racketeering have also since been added against him. The disgraced man of cloth was arrested on the 20th of April by the Hawks shortly after he landed at the Port Elizabeth International Airport after evading arrest for days when the scandal came out. Rumours had made rounds that he had already skipped the country. At the airport, he had apparently tried to avoid arrest by first lying about his flight's arrival time then hiding in public toilets at the airport when he found armed officers waiting for him. Last year, he made two attempts to geet bail, which failed. Two women, who are alleged to have been responsible for recruiting and grooming girls for the 59-year-old Pastor, Lusanda Solani and Zukiswa Sitho, were also arrested last year. They were granted bail and are expected to appear in court with Omotoso.
