 Dam levels in most parts of the country have shown a considerable increase, with the exception of Eastern Cape, the Department of Water and Sanitation announced. According to the water levels report published by the Department of Water and Sanitation this week, Eastern Cape recorded a meager 0.1% increase, moving from 66.6% last week to 66.7% this week. "This is a clear sign that the province is facing serious drought and dam levels could even drop more drastically due to the changing of seasons," it described. "The Algoa Water System, which is serving the major dams in the Nelson Mandela Metro is dropping week on week. "This week the System decreased from 25.1% last week to 24.7% this week." It added that major dams in this System are struggling to gain more water. "Dam such as Impofu is sitting at 38.5%, Kouga Dam is battling a lot and is sitting at 10.9%, Swartkops Dam at 50.7% and Loerie is the only dam sitting at 100.3% this week. "The Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS) is appealing to the communities of Nelson Mandela Bay and Sarah Baartman to continue saving water during this period of drought," the Department said. "Meanwhile, the Amathole Water Supply System, serving dams in Buffalo City Municipality has shown some signs of recovery in recent weeks, improving from 88.9% last week to 90.4% this week. "Klipplaat is standing at 70.3% a huge improvement compared to the previous year at this time, it was 58.1%. Gubu Dam is sitting at 100.8% this week, Laing Dam is standing at 100.4% this week and Rooikrantz Dam remain at 100.8%." It said another major concern is Xilinxa Dam in Butterworth which is still as low as 25.5% and residents of this area are urged to head the calls of water conservation and take them seriously. "Water users are further reminded that Eastern Cape has been declared as National disaster area due to acute water challenges and reduction in water usage will play a huge role in ensuring that we avoid running out of water."
