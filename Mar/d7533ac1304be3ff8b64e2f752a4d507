 Four menÂ and a woman, aged between 37 and 57 years old, are expected in court soon after they were arrested by police for selling stolen cattle. According to police spokesperson, Captain Mali Govender, at approximately 12:00 on Monday, a constable from the Family Violence Child Protection and Sexual Offence unit at Peddie recieved information about a truck that was loading stolen cattle in Peddie. "He stopped that truck and the bakkie that was escorting the truck, which was driven by the buyer of the stolen cattle. "Members of the Grahamstown Stock Theft Unit were alerted and responded," she described. "13 cattle were recovered of which 9 have already been positively identified." The suspects face 13 counts of stock theft and will appear in the Peddie Magistrate's Court later this week. Brigadier David Kanuka said; "We have had several cases of stock theft reported. The suspects will face additional charges as our investigators probe this recovery further. "The stock theft unit had issued a fine of R5 000 today in terms of the Branding Act. One hundred and twenty two sheep were not tattooed. Our operations focussing on stock theft are intensified. "We are appealing to the community to report stock theft and stock owners to take responsibility and brand their stock. This assists the investigators to know who the stock belongs to when we have recoveries of this nature."
