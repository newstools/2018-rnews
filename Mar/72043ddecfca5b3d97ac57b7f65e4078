 President Cyril Ramaphosa has directed Minister of Basic Education Angie Motshekga to conduct an audit of all learning facilities with unsafe structures, especially unsafe ablution facilities, within a month. The Presidency said after the audit Minister Motshekga is expected to present a plan to rectify the challenges, as an emergency interim measure, while rolling out proper infrastructure, within three months. This comes after five-year-old Viwe Jali died after falling into a pit toilet at the Luna Primary School in Bizana, Eastern Cape. The Presidency said President Ramaphosa was appalled and saddened at the passing away of the learner. He has expressed his condolences to Viwe’s family and relatives on their devastating loss. “The President has also expressed his grave concern about the safety of facilities in schools, especially when it comes to a lack of decent ablution facilities,” the Presidency said. “As the President committed in the State of the Nation Address, the plan to eliminate unsafe ablution facilities will be participatory, with civil society being consulted. To this end, he further welcomes input by civil society organizations who continue to champion the struggle for safe and decent school infrastructure,” the Presidency said in a statement on Friday. President Ramaphosa has committed government to spare no effort in ensuring that children can learn in safe and conducive facilities, in memory of Viwe and Michael Komape. Both learners lost their lives under similar circumstances. – SAnews.gov.za
