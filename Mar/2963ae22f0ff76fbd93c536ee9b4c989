 The eradication and clamping down on illicit sale of drugs continue to be the focus in the Mount Road Policing Cluster. "During this weekend, 18 people were arrested for drug related cases," said police spokesperson, Col Priscilla Naidu. "Drugs such as tik, mandrax, dagga; heroin and prescription tablets were confiscated." She said that on Sunday, members of Port Elizabeth Flying Squad arrested two women, aged 31 and 38 years old, who were in possession of a large quantity of prescription tablets. "The members acted on information received and at about 11:00 spotted the woman walking in Standford Road in Port Elizabeth. "As the women saw the police vehicle, they hastily walked into the parking area at the hospital," described Col Naidu. "Members approached them and after searching their bag found 6 000 stilpane tablets and cash. The women could not provide a reasonable explanation as to the possession of such a large quantity." The women, from George, were both arrested on a charge of dealing/illegal possession of prescribed medication under the Medicine Control Act. "They will appear in the Gelvandale Magistrate's Court on Monday."
