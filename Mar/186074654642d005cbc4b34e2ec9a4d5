 The Hawks have dismissed media reports alleging that the crime-fighting unit is investigating Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan. The reports allege that the investigations relate to the SARS High-Risk Investigation Unit probe. The Hawks have been investigating the former so-called “rogue” intelligence unit for supposedly taking part in illegal interceptions and spying. Hawks spokesperson Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi said the media allegations are devoid of any truth. “To put the record straight, there are no investigations nor impending charges preferred against Minister Pravin Gordhan,” Mulaudzi said on Tuesday. He said the media reports are being motivated by personal agendas and a “willing channel of anonymous mischievousness”. Mulaudzi, however, did indicate that the Hawks and the National Prosecuting Authority have formally charged three accused persons – Ivan Pillay, Johann van Loggerenberg and Andries Janse van Rensburg. According to Mulaudzi, they have been issued with a summons to appear in the Pretoria Regional Court on April 9 on alleged charges of corruption and contravention of the Regulation of Interception of Communications and Provision of Communication-Related Information Act (RICA). “It is thus not true that the Hawks are gunning for Minister Pravin Gordhan. It is also not true that any official from the Hawks briefed the former Minister of Police, Fikile Mbalula, of any investigation against Minister Pravin Gordhan nor provide him with any information detailing developments and so-called compelling evidence.” - SAnews.gov.za
