These elections are expected to take place between May and August 2019. Critically, this registration weekend is a milestone towards the culmination of a two-year project to obtain addresses for all registered voters by June 2018. It is also an opportunity to ensure that voters are registered in the correct voting district segments. South Africans might recall the ruling of the Constitutional Court in 2016 which gave the Electoral Commission until June 2018 to update the voters’ roll with all available addresses. Over the past two years the Electoral Commission has made significant progress in updating addresses on the voters’ roll including: The following are the current voters’ roll statistics: Voter’s roll category                                           Number of registered voters* Complete address                                                19 418 210 (75%) REC AS address                                                  115 142 (0.4%) Incomplete/generic address                                 3 551 266 (14%) No recorded address                                            2 815 160 (11%) Total registered voters                                          25 899 778 *As at 30 November 2017 Despite its best efforts to collect the addresses of voters, the Electoral Commission does not have addresses for 2.8 million voters. A further 3.5 million addresses are currently classified as “incomplete” or “generic”. “The voters’ roll is a fundamental safeguard for free and fair elections. It is an instrument for facilitating electoral participation, which is placed at the disposal of political parties for campaign purposes. It serves a functional purpose as a planning tool for accurate provision of electoral material and the avoidance of electoral fraud,” says Chief Electoral Officer, Sy Mamabolo. He once again urged all voters to make every effort to visit their voting stations during the weekend of the 10 and 11 March 2018.  “We are ready to open all the voting stations this weekend for all voters to easily update their address details on the voters’ roll, and for first-time voters to register. We need voters to show up and make use of the opportunity,” says Mamabolo.
