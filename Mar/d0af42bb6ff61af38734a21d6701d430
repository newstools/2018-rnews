 Former Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality Executive Mayor, Danny Jordaan, who is the current South African Football Association (SAFA) boss, could have his day in court after a singer and a former African National Congress (ANC) MP, Jennifer Ferguson, opened a rape case against him. "After many months of deep consideration, consultation and attempts to mediate according to principles of restorative justice as embodied by the Truth and Reconciliation process South Africa has followed, I have decided to lay a charge of rape against Danny Jordaan," Ferguson wrote on her Facebook. "I do this in the hope that other victims of sexual abuse will be empowered to speak out and act. I do this and ask for your support prayerful, in thought or action for all those affected by his sexual misconduct. "I also am aware of the distress his family must be experiencing and express my sadness that they are inevitably affected." Last year, in October, Ferguson claimed that Jordaan raped herÂ in a Port Elizabeth hotel about 24 years ago. In a statement through his lawyer, Mamodupi Mohlala-Mulaudzi, Jordaan denied raping Ferguson. "From a legal viewpoint, serious allegations of the kind made by Ms Ferguson can only be ventilated in a court of law, where the rights of all parties are protected," the statement read.
