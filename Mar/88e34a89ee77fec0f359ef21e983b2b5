 SAPS Motherwell Cluster Commander, Major General Dawie Rabie, has expressed concern about large groups of armed suspects involved in armed robberies over the past weekend. "We are hunting down this group of between 12 to 15 suspects ,who were responsible for the robbery of Swartkops Spar and Tops Liquors on Friday, as well as the OK Furnishers at Motherwell Shopping Centre on Sunday. "We need our community to give information to us when they become aware of suspicious sales of cigarettes, airtime, cellphones and laptops," he added. According to police information, on Friday, at about 18:30, 12 to 15 suspects robbed Spar and Tops Liquors in Swartkops. They took cigarettes, cash and liquor from the stores. "A SAPS member visiting the Spar was also assaulted and fired upon at close range after the returning robbers found him in his vehicle in the parking lot," police said. "They intended to rob him of his fire arm, and on realising that he was unarmed, they pulled him from his vehicle, assaulted him and fired several shots at him. "Fortunately, he was not wounded in the shooting. An armed robbery case was opened as well as the attempted murder case on the SAPS member." Police added that on Sunday, at about 12:40, a group of about 12 armed suspects entered the OK Furnishers store in Motherwell. "The clients as well as staff were kept at gunpoint in a corner of the store, and while some suspects robbed them of their valuables, the rest robbed the store itself. 10 cellphones and cash were robbed from clients, and a further 70 cellphones, 8 laptops and tablets and cash were robbed from the store." Any person with information about these stolen goods or the criminals responsible for these robberies can contact the Motherwell Serious Violent Crime Unit, Captain Jerome Mackay at 071 475 2015.
