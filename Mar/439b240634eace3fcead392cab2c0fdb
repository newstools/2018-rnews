 Alert Port Elizabeth police officers on Thursday morning recovered two firearms, which police now suspect were stolen during a house robbery in January, after they were dropped by two men in Kwazakhele as they fled from a police patrol. According to police spokesperson, Captain Andre Beetge, the SAPS members were doing their patrol duties in Makata Street, Kwazakhele, when the duo suddenly ran towards the opposite direction. “The two dropped their two firearms while running to avoid arrest after they spotted the police. “The firearms, a 7.65 and a .38 revolver, with four rounds of ammunition were sent for forensic testing as their serial numbers were filed off,” he said. “The SAPS are suspecting that the firearms were robbed during a house break-in in the Seven Fountains area in January this year.” He added that leads are being followed up and arrests are expected soon.
