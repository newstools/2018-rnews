 The Pietermaritzburg High Court on Tuesday sentenced Ben Zimele Mbhele (32) to four life sentences for four counts of murder after he pleaded guilty to all counts. His sentence came after the court heard how he brutally murdered his sister’s children in Ncukeni area on 2 September 2017, in Port Edward. The KwaZulu-Natal Acting Provincial Commissioner, Major General Bheki Langa, welcomed the sentence handed to the accused. “This sentence will also serve as a warning to other criminals who think they will get away after committing crimes. “We hope this sentence will bring closure to the family,” he said. Mbhele was arrested at the beginning of March by Port Edward police at his home in Ncukeni area after a lengthy investigation by a team of investigators tasked to solve the killing of minors. "On 2 September 2017 at 07:00, three children aged between four and twelve were found lying inside the house with multiple stab wounds in their upper bodies and their left ears were cut," described police spokesperson, Captain Nqobile Gwala. "The other body was found lying outside the house with multiple stab wounds." Police did not divulge the motive for the killing. "The children were alone at the time of the attack. Four counts of murder were opened at Port Edward police station for investigation. Suspect will be charged for four counts of murder," Captain Gwala. Mbhele made his first court apperance in the Ramsgate Magistrates’ Court on 12 March 2018. “We will ensure that a well-prepared docket is sent to court so that the accused can be prosecuted for these horrendous acts. The cruelty that was displayed during the killing cannot be explained as it was too vicious especially as it was committed by a relative who is expected to be the protector to these children,” Major General Langa said then.
