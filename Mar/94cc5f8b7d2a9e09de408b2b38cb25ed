He told the meeting that the CF will establish a dedicated Call Centre competency to handle CF-Filling system related queries and training on the system will commence in April 2018. Mafata hinted to attendants on changes to policy and legislative environment such as the Compensation for Injuries and Diseases’ Employer Assessment Model which currently has 24 classes with 102 subclasses resulting in 102 rates. He said this changes will result in reducing the classes from 24 to five classes. The changes are expected to come into effect in April 2019.
