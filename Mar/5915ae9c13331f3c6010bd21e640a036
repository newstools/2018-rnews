 The African National Congress (ANC) Study Group on Water and Sanitation on Wednesday said that it supports the decision for a full investigation in a form of a parliamentary inquiry into the Department of Water and Sanitation. The Department, which was run by then Minister, Nomvula Mokonyane, is apparently broke after overspending its R14 billion budget by R2 billion, but reportedly met only 28% of its targets. Parliament now wants a full inquiry into corruption and maladministration in the Department.  "The call for an investigation comes as one of the recommendations of the committee’s Budgetary Review and Recommendation Report (BRRR) adopted by the National Assembly in November 2017," said ANC Study Group on Water and Sanitation Whip, Hlomane Patrick Chauke. "Today, the Portfolio Committee on Water and Sanitation had a joint meeting with the Standing Committee on Public Accounts (SCOPA), to map out the terms of reference for the inquiry." Chauke said that having identified the key focal points for the inquiry, which include but not limited to, the  mismanagement of public funds, lack of leadership and failure of project management; the joint meeting agreed to engage the Auditor General and National Treasury in order to determine the scope for the investigation. "The meeting also agreed that the inquiry will be a full one, with an evidence leader and witnesses from within and outside the department. "This process will work concurrently with law enforcement agencies, namely, the Hawks and Special Investigations Unit (SIU)," he added. "Where there are issued identified that require the attention of these law enforcement agencies, they will automatically be referred and a case will immediately be opened. "The inquiry will commence once time frames have been set and agreed."
