 Three suspects, two men and a woman, were arrested after a hijacked vehicle was recovered on the M19 off ramp close to Swartkops, in Port Elizabeth, on Monday. "This followed after members of the Motherwell Operational Command Centre spotted a suspicious silver Tata Indica driving on the M17 road towards Swartkops," said police spokesperson, Captain Andre Beetge. "They followed and pulled the vehicle off at 14:30 on the M19 off ramp after realising the vehicle had a false number plate in front. "On further investigation it was discovered that the Tata was hijacked in Humewood area on 1 March 2018. The false number plate belonged to a blue VW Golf that was stolen during July 2015 in Kwazakele." He said that all three occupants, two males - aged 33 and 38, and a female, aged 20, were arrested for the possession of a hijacked vehicle. "They will appear before the Motherwell Magistrates Court on Wednesday."
