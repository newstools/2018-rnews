 The Grahamstown High Court on Thursday sentenced a 55-year-old East London man to 18 years direct imprisonment after convicting him for the murder of his wife in May 2017. Sicelo Nxeke, from Komga, alleged and based his actions on grounds that the deceased had been engaged in extramarital affair, with another man from Komga, according to police spokesperson, CaptainÂ Nkosikho Mzuku. "Later to his version, he pleaded guilty, which made his version rather questionble in the eyes of the State, and it was later denied," he added. "Dismissal of the accused's plea had ascended when his version, on the Friday leading to the trial, was found contradictory in comparison to the evidence in the docket, which consisted primarily of the deceased's version." Captain Mzuku said that on a quest to successfully challenge the accused's version, the investigating officer, Sgt Ayanda Sihu, determined to trace the man the accused had alleged had been having an affair with the deceased. "Thus, successfully locating him in Komga. "Upon their meeting, the said man had agreed to become a state witness against the accused and he testified for the state on 6 March 2018," he described. "It must be stated that if the court had accepted the accused's version, a sentence in the region of 8-10 years imprisonment could have been expected, on a basis that it was a crime of passion. "This due diligence by the investigating officer, Sgt Sihu, enabled the court to reject the accused's version, which was under false pretence." Captain Mzuku said that Sergeant Sihu is a mere example of SAPS's dedication and has again shown another brave act of ensuring justice is served.
