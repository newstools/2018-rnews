 Police are alerting local businesses to inform their staff to lock away all valuables, including keys to safes, before retiring for the day. This warning comes after a post office in Walmer, Port Elizabeth, was broken into over the weekend. "It is alleged that at about 06:30 , when a staff member arrived at the post office on Monday morning, the employee found that the padlock to the main gate was broken," police spokesperson, Col Priscilla Naidu said. "On further investigation, the main door was also pried open with a crowbar. "Several offices were broken into and safes in three offices were opened. Petty cash was taken. An unknown number of parcels were also taken from the main office." She said that keys to safes should never be left in the drawers in the office nor should safes be left unlocked. "Companies must ensure that their alarm systems are in working order at all times. "Always run emergency drills with the alarm company to test the working condition of the devices," Col Naidu added. "Police are investigating a case of housebreaking (business)."
