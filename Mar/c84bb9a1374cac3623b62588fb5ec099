 Two G4S security guards returning a vehicle from a cash collection were allegedly overpowered by five armed men during a cash-in-transit heist in Bluewater Bay, Port Elizabeth, on Tuesday. According to police spokesperson, Captain Andre Beetge, the two security guards' firearms were also taken, as well as cash bags containing a substantial amount of money. “The five suspects fled the scene using two vehicles, a green Ford Tracer and a white Nissan NP200. However, nobody was seriously injured during the incident,” he described. Later the police discovered that the two vehicles used were hijacked from their owners hours before the robbery, just a few minutes before the heist. “The white Nissan NP200 was at Truckers Inn, Wells Estate, and the Green Ford Tracer within Wells Estate. In both cases, two armed suspects gun pointed the owners and took their vehicles," he Captain Beetge said. “The two drivers and one passenger were then taken to Wells Estate beach where they were tied up by the suspects and left in the bushes. “After more than three hours, these owners managed to free themselves and went to Ikamvelihle police station to report the two hijackings, where the SAPS linked the two crimes." Captain Beetge said just before the sunset, both vehicles were recovered after being abandoned. “A Ford Tracer was found in Old Grahamstown road, Deal Party by SAPS K9 Unit at about 16:50, and the Nissan NP200 was found by Motherwell Cluster Operational Command Centre (OCC) members in Avenue C, New Brighton at 17:00.” Motherwell Cluster Commander, Major General Dawie Rabie said that "these hijackings and cash-in-transit heists seem to have been well-planned, and SAPS will pull all the stops in order to arrest these criminals". Any person with more information about these robbers can contact the investigating officer at Motherwell Serious Violent Crime Unit, Captain Jerome Mackay at 071 475 2015.
