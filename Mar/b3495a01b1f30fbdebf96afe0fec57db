 Police are urging garage staff to be vigilant and alert when they notice two or more people walking into the convenient store especially during late nights and early hours of the morning. "As soon as there is suspicion that something is amiss, they should activate their panic alarm button," said police spokesperson,Â Col Priscilla Naidu. "At about 23:00, on Saturday night, a garage was robbed for the second time in Govan Mbeki Avenue in Central, Port Elizabeth. The garage was also robbed the previous night." She said that it is alleged that four unknown men entered the shop and took two pies. "When the cashier told them the price, a firearm was pointed at her and a fifth suspect also entered. "They demanded the cash from the till and helped themselves to chips, pies, cigarettes and cooldrinks before leaving," Col Naidu said. "The suspects got into a white Toyota Avanza, which was parked nearby." She said that it is also alleged that on Friday evening, at about the same time, a white VW Golf filled petrol at the same garage and thereafter parked away from the garage. "Two suspects then ran into the shop, produced a firearm and robbed the cashier. They also helped themselves to cigarettes and cooldrinks before fleeing into the waiting vehicle," Col Naidu added. "Police are investigating whether the suspects are the same as the modus operandi appears to be similar. Cases of business robbery are under investigation."
