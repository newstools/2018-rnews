"The deceased was stabbed multiple wounds all over the body and died on 02 June 2016 at about 20:00 at Mabheleni Location, Candu Village, Dutywa. "Both Lwando Ramba and Yandisa Tunce were hired by the Zimkhitha Tetyana to murder her husband." Captain Manatha said that there was a misunderstanding between the wife and the deceased, which led to the wife to hire the two accused. "The wife was arrested on 03 June 2016 and the two other accused were arrested on 04 June 2016. "Each accused was sentenced to undergo life imprisonment. Both sentences are taken as one (1) for purposes of sentences," her added.
