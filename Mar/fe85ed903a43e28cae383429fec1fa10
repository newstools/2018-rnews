 Police in Port Elizabeth extended a helping hand to a local woman from Zwide after her home burnt down on the 8th of March leaving her and family with only the clothes they were wearing. Officers managed to raise R1 600 as well as other goods to help Ntambencinci Hele and her two children, aged 14 and 10, get back on their feet. The three have been living with their neighbour ever since the incident. Hele is employed as an admin clerk at the Ikamvelihle police station. Police spokesperson, Captain Andre Beetge, said: “The Ikamvelihle Station Commander, Lt Colonel Nomsa Mtshagi, spearheaded a plight to fellow policemen and women to donate cash, clothing and food items to assist the family in their time of need. “An amount of just over R 1600 and other donations were received from all the stations of the Motherwell Cluster, and today [Monday], these were handed over to Hele at Ikamvelihle Police Station.” Hele said that she urgently needs uniforms for her two children so that they can continue with their studies. Any person that wishes to assist can contact the Ikamvelihle station commander at 041 402 5204.
