 President Cyril Ramaphosa has reiterated that land expropriation without compensation must be done within the confines of the law. “When we talk about the return of the land to our people, we have got to do everything in an orderly way, in terms of our laws, in terms of our Constitution, so that everybody’s rights are protected and advanced,” he said on Sunday. The President was speaking in his capacity as head of the African National Congress (ANC) during a voter registration drive at the New Creation Covenant Church in Olievenhoutbosch, Pretoria. Olievenhoutbosch residents picketed outside the church calling for service delivery and adequate housing in the area ahead of President Ramaphosa’s address at the church. The voter registration drive forms part of the Electoral Commission’s (IEC) efforts to get eligible voters to register and update their details on the voters roll as mandated by the Constitution to allow them to vote in the 2019 national elections. The commission opened 22 600 voting stations at the weekend to allow citizens to easily update their details on the voters’ roll. President Ramaphosa assured residents that Premier David Makhura, who also participated in the event on Sunday, would meet with them on Thursday to hear their concerns and look for solutions. Speaking to congregants, the President said the ruling party had taken a resolution at its 54th National Conference to expropriate land without compensation and this would be done in a measured manner. “The land issue has to advance the interests of our people. So that our people can return to the land and work the land and grow our economy but as we do that we have to do it in terms of the rules and the laws we have; in terms of the agreements and laws we have in our country. “A new dawn must mean we do things in a proper way, without any fraud, corruption or violating the law,” said President Ramphosa. – SAnews.gov.za
