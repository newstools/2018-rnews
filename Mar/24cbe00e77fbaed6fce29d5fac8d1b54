 The Office of the African National Congress (ANC) Chief Whip in the National Assembly on Thursday confirmed the resignation of former Minister of Public Enterprises, Lynne Brown, as a member of Parliament effective 27 February 2018. "Comrade Brown joined the National Assembly in 2014 and had Â previously served as a member of the Western Cape Provincial Legislature in various capacities from 1994 till 2014," said ANC Chief Whip, Jackson Mthembu. "She has expressed her gratitude in having served the people of South Africa and thanked the ANC for having given her the opportunity to do so. "We are confident that she will continue serving the country and our movement in other capacities in future. We wish her well." Brown's resignation comes after she was dropped from President Cyril Ramaphosa's new Cabinet. Her tenure as Minister was characterised by controversy over her handling of the crises at Eskom and at the South African Airways (SAA). She had been accused of being in the pocket of the controversial Gupta family.
