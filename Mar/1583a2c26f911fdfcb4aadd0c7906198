 Police in Port Elizabeth are warning firearm dealers and owners to thoroughly familiarise themselves with the Firearms Control Act, Act 60 of 2000 to avoid cases opened against them and their firearm/s confiscated. This warning emanates after a 54-year-old firearm tradesman was arrested and charged for unlawful possession of firearms. "It is alleged that on Tuesday, members from Walmer Crime Prevention Unit executed a search warrant on the owner at his house in Westering. "On inspecting the hunting rifles on the premises, seven rifles belonging to other owners were stored in the safe without a safekeeping permit in possession of the tradesman," said police spokesperson, Colonel Priscilla Naidu. "The rifles were confiscated and the person arrested and charged for unlawful possession of a firearms." She said that Christo Janse Van Rensburg appeared in the Port Elizabeth regional court on Wednesday and the case was remanded to 20 April 2018 for further investigation. "Firearm owners, who intend leaving their firearms with other licenced persons for safekeeping, must ensure that a safekeeping permit is obtained from the Designated Firearms Officer at his nearest police station before handing it in for safekeeping," Col Naidu added. "It is a known fact that firearms contribute to the commission of many serious crimes, ranging from domestic violence disputes to armed robberies and murders, be it at the hands of legal or illegal owners. "Each year, many licenced firearms are lost or stolen, thereby contributing to the proliferation of firearms that are in the hands of criminals. The Firearms Control Act plays a pivotal role in the control of legal firearms and the reduction in the proliferation and availability of illegal firearms in our country."
