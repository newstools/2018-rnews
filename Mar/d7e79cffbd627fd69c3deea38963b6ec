 National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) head, Shaun Abrahams, is on Thursday expected to announce his decision on whether former President Jacob Zuma will be prosecuted for corruption or not. This is after the Constitutional Court on Wednesday dismissed an application by the Council for the Advancement of the South African Constitution, which sought to delay Abrahams's announcement on the matter. Abrahams in February asked his prosecuting team to report to him on whether Zuma should be prosecuted for charges relating to the so-called spy tapes saga. Upon receipt thereof, he was expected to advise on the way forward. In October 2017, Zuma lost his appeal when the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) upheld a decision by the Pretoria High Court that charges against Zuma should be reinstated. It said that the decision to withdraw the 783 counts of corruption against Zuma years ago was “irrational”. The charges relate to Zuma's relationship with controversial businessman, Shabir Shaik, who was tried and found guilty in 2005 of soliciting bribes from a French arms company apparently for the benefit of Zuma. Zuma and other government officials were accused of taking kickbacks from the purchase of fighter jets, patrol boats and other arms. The charges were first brought against Zuma in 2005, but dropped by the NPA in 2009. The reason was of the charges being dropped was the 'spy tapes' - recordings of phone conversations that apparently showed there was 'political meddling' in the prosecution of the case by Zuma's political rivals. Weeks later, Zuma became President of the country after former President Thabo Mbeki was recalled by the African National Congress (ANC). Zuma was given until end of January to make presentations to the NPA on why he should not face the charges.
