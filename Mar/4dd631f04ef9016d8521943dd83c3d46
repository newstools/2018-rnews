 The Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality on Monday held its National Book Week Media Launch at Elukhanyisweni Library, in KwaNobuhle, Uitenhage. Elukhanyisweni Library is a special library, which offers incredible facilities for the blind. The library has a Braille device, which has audio cues to make their lives easier while they learn. Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality Executive Mayor, Athol Trollip, who was the keynote speaker at the event, emphasised on the importance of reading. He also called on parents to encourage their children to make use of the municipal libraries across the City next week over the annual Library Week, which will start next week the 16th till the 23 of March. The Executive Mayor committed to mobilise resources to improve to facilities and build more libraries in areas where there are none. He also called on the residents to protect the libraries from criminals activities. At the event, residents had an opportunity to raise their concerns. Anele Kopo, a member of the local ward committee, said that the library has slow internet and also suggested that its opening hours be extended. Mayor Trollip promised Kopo that something will be done about that because no one visits a library to stay there for three hours while waiting for a document to finish downloading. The Mayor also assured the community that they will have to engage the local labour unions about the time extensions for librarians while emphasising that “they are also human and have their lives to live” – so cannot be expected to always work long hours at the library. Local Ward Councillor, Simphiwe Ntshiza, said that all municipal officials must have workshops after a complaint about their unfriendliness towards residents, who visit the library and ask to be helped around the library to find books. The Mayor also advised the community to ask for the municipal officials’ names and report them “because no one forced anyone to come and work for the municipality”.
