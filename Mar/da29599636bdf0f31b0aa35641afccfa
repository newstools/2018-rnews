 President Cyril Ramaphosa’s first oral reply session on Wednesday will see him give an update on burning issues, including land expropriation without compensation. “The President is expected to give an update on government’s land reform programme, with land expropriation without compensation as one of its programmes,” said the Presidency. He is also expected to give an update on issues such as economic recovery, the review of the Mining Charter and matters relating to the National Prosecuting Authority. Tomorrow’s session will mark the first of many question and reply sessions by President Ramaphosa since assuming his duties as President of the Republic on 15 February 2018. Questions for oral reply by the President are one of the mechanisms utilised by Parliament to hold the President and the National Executive to account and are scheduled for at least once per quarter. - SAnews.gov.za
