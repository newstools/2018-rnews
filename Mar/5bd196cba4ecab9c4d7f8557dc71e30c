 The South African National Roads Agency Ltd (SANRAL) would like to notify travellers that controlled blasting is scheduled to continue to take place on N2 Section 13, between Grahamstown and Fish River Pass, on Thursday 22 March 2018, weather permitting. The blasts will take place between 2pm and 4:30pm. The road will be closed for approximately one-hour during this time. The blast will take place approximately 25 to 35km east of Grahamstown, along the N2, between KM 78,7 and KM 92,6 route markers. An alternative route to consider from Port Elizabeth to East London is via the R72 through Port Alfred.  “Motorists are advised to plan their journeys accordingly,” said Mbulelo Peterson, SANRAL Southern Region Manager.
