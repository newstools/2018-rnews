 The Butterworth Regional Magistrate's Court on Monday sentenced a 27-year-old man to undergo 10 years imprisonment after convicting him of the murder of his 35-year-old wife. "The accused, Siphe Hleziphondo, was also sentenced to undergo five imprisonment for assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm as he also stabbed a woman who witnessed the murder," said police spokesperson, Captain Jackson Manatha. "The murder was committed on 02 September 2017 at about 18:00 at Nqabara Village, Dutywa. "Both the deceased, Qondiswa Siwundla, and the accused were in a tarven when the murder was committed." He said that Siwundla was jealous as her husband was busy with other women at the tarven. "The deceased was stabbed multiple wounds all over her body. She died at the crime scene," Captain Manatha said. "A woman, who was a witness was also stabbed, but managed to run away and alerted other people about the murder."
