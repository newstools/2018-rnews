 Port Elizabeth police on Thursday morning recovered the body of a 54-year-old Bluewater Bay man, who had been missing since February. John du Plessis' body was recovered at the Aloes Nature Reserve, in Amsterdamhoek, just adjacent to Bluewater Bay. According to police spokesperson, Captain Andre Beetge, the SAPS and Rescue K9 Unit had been scouring the bushes in the Swartkops estuary over the past few weeks. Du Plessis was reported missing on the 20th of February. “This morning at about 08:30, his body was found by one of the rescue dogs in an area deep inside the dense bushes of the Aloes Nature Reserve, about 2 kilometres from Tippers Creek, Amsterdamhoek,” Captain Beetge described. “The recovery team needed to make use of a quadbike and stretcher to get the body back to the closest access point for the rescue and police vehicles.” He added that an autopsy will be conducted to establish the cause of death. “However, SAPS investigators are suspecting suicide as a bottle of a poisonous substance was found next to his body,” Captain Beetge said.
