 Eastern Cape Premier, Phumulo Masualle, on Friday officially opened the Eastern Cape House of Traditional Leaders. In his speech, Masualle called upon all traditional leaders to play a crucial role in fostering social cohesion given the demands that confront government and local authorities. “We have hope that by working together we will make it possible by decisions we make to always continue to empower ourselves so that we can stand decisions that need our leadership,” he said. “Your term at this august house in this critical instrument in our system of government begins at a time of great excitement and potential for our country. “This hope of renewal, which many call a new dawn has affirmed each time together with the president and the rest of national office barriers of the leadership in partnership  with the masses of the people from all walks of life across the country.” Premier Masualle said that he welcomes the proposal for land without compensation which was tabled and passed in the National Assembly this past week with great excitement. “The skewed pattern of land ownership and of the economy that the majority of our people are still largely logged out of some 24 years after the dawn of democracy is the real making for economic failure,” he described. Masualle added that land expropriation without compensation by law will actually ensure that food security is uncompromised and that the country’s agricultural sector - a significant employer and contributor to Gross Domestic Product (GDP), is secured.
