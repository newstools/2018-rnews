 The Democratic Alliance (DA) in the Eastern Cape has written a letter to Eastern Cape Social Development MEC, Nancy Sihlwayi, asking her to intervene at the King William’s Town Child and Youth Care Centre (KWT CYCC) where it says close to 100 children’s futures remain uncertain as there are proposals to close the centre down. "Meanwhile, social development officials and the management team of the centre squabble over allegations of wrongdoing," said Kobus Botha (MPL), DA Eastern Cape Shadow MEC for Social Development. Botha said that after conducting an oversight visit to the KWT CYCC last week Tuesday to ensure that the children’s rights and well-being are a priority, he found that the children were clean, well dressed and happy; some were busy with educational activities.  "I believe that department officials failed to follow just administrative action that is lawful, reasonable and procedurally fair in dealing with the concerned matters," he added.  "Allegedly, the department did not officially inform the KWT CYCC of any legislative shortcomings and the centre’s management team was not offered an opportunity to correct any inadequacies. "A joint turnaround strategy must also be developed and implemented with timeframes considered, to ensure that non-compliance with legislative requirements is corrected." Botha said that the department needs to ensure that monitoring and evaluation happens regularly between themselves and the organisation. "I call on both parties to reconcile their differences. This issue needs to be prioritised for the sake of these children who have developed strong bonds with one another, the staff and school teachers in the community," he added.
