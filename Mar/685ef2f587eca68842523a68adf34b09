 The Coega Development Corporation (CDC) ends off the week by being nominated as one of the finalists at the Oliver Top Empowerment Awards taking place on the 12th of April 2018 at the Emperors Palace in Johannesburg. The CDC’s nomination as a finalist in the category “Business of the Year Award” follows the organisations prior nomination at the start of this year, as a finalist at the prestigious fifth Annual SA Premier Business Awards. The Oliver Empowerment Awards has applauded the CDC for embracing the BEE transformation processes and the organisation’s commitment to social development and upliftment. The Business of the Year Award is a headline award, which goes to the organisation that best demonstrates excellence in all spheres of the general criteria and seven pillars of empowerment. “It’s gratifying to be acknowledged for the work we doing. The category the CDC is nominated for is underpinned by the vision of the organisation to be the leading catalyst for the championing of socio-economic growth,” Christopher Mashigo, CDC executive manager business development.
