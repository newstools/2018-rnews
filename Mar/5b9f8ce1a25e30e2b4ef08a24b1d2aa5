 The time has come for the people of the Nelson Mandela Bay (NMB) to raise their voices and lobby all councillors in the municipal council to not hand the City back to the corrupt and ineffective African National Congress (ANC), the Democratic Alliance (DA) says. A special council meeting has been scheduled for next week Thursday to decide the future of Athol Trollip as Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality Executive Mayor. It's not just Trollip facing chop, but also members of his Mayoral Committee as well as Council Speaker, Jonathan Lawack, and Chief Whip, Werner Senekal. "The people of NMB decisively rejected the corrupt ANC at the ballot box during the 2016 local government elections with 59.1% of voters choosing to vote for other political parties. They made it clear, through their vote, that they wanted total change and a new government," said Mlindi Nhanha - DA Eastern Cape Provincial Spokesperson. "The coalition government is making continued progress in rooting out corruption, bringing about financial stability, and delivering services across NMB. The total change and progress the coalition government has brought about is undeniable." He said that under Mayor Trollip the coalition: "The motion of no confidence in Mayor Trollip and the entire DA-led coalition government by the EFF seeks to undo all this good work and progress. All this will do is hand the City back to the corrupt ANC and undermine the democratic results of the 2016 election," Nhanha said. "We are therefore releasing the names, telephone numbers and e-mail addresses of all NMB councillors. Residents can make use of this information to lobby all councillors to not bring the City to its knees and undermine South African democracy." Speaking at a rally in Uitenhage on Tuesday, DA leader, Mmusi Maimane, said they will fight the motions with everything they have got.
