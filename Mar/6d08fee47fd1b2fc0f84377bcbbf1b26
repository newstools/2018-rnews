 The Boardwalk Casino and Entertainment World in Port Elizabeth will now be proceeding with plans to build a mall at the complex after getting the nod from authorities. Boardwalk Casino owner, Emfuleni Resorts, outlined its proposal to develop a R1.3 billion mixed-use development on currently under-utilised land in the Boardwalk Precinct back in 2016. That same year, the company had reportedly abandoned the development after an extended gambling licence was refused by the Eastern Cape Gaming Board. Boardwalk Hotel General Manger, Mike van Vuuren, confirmed at a media breakfast on Tuesday that construction is now expected to begin in September this year after they got approval from the Eastern Cape Gaming Board. “Most of the lake will be removed together with a Sun Park, and within that Sun Park we will be able to host various kinds of events that have not been able to be hosted in Port Elizabeth because it will be a multipurpose venue which can really be put to good use,” said van Vuuren. Van Vuuren stated that they are currently in the phase of acquiring tenants for the mall, but could not yet release the names of those that have agreed to be part of the project. “I’m pleased to say, from a tenanting point of view, we’ve got three major National retailers that have got board approval to be part of our development, which generally kick-starts other retailers to come and bring themselves to the mall as well,” said van Vuuren. "In addition, to that, Nelson Mandela Bay is the host city to the Ironman Africa Championships in April and the Ironman 70.3 World Championship in September, with the Boardwalk as a central hub to both events."
