 Police in Despatch have issued a warning to businesses and residents to be vigilant when handling cash as they could fall victim to a counterfeit syndicate, which is distributing fake notes in the area. This follows the arrest of a 38-year-old man on Friday, who was found in possession of counterfeit money - R100 notes. "The arrest followed after a local business notified the police about the person trying to transfer money through Money Market," said police spokesperson, Gerda Swart. Uitenhage Cluster police spokesperson, Captain Gerda Swart said: “We are appealing to the community, vendors and businesses to be vigilant as they may fall prey. We urge people to scrutinize all bank notes, from R10 to R200 bills, and to be on the lookout for anything suspicious. The money looks genuine but one must pay more attention to the various security features. It is also advisable to make use of counterfeit detector machines”. The 38-year-old male suspect was due to appear in the Uitenhage Magistrate’s Court on Monday on a charge of possession of counterfeit money. "Investigations are continuing and we are hoping that more arrests will follow, ultimately resulting in all the counterfeit cash being found and seized as well as the machine that is used to print it," said Capt Swart.
