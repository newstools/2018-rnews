 Following the Minister of Health’s announcement earlier on Sunday afternoon on the source of the listeria outbreak, Pick n Pay has acted immediately to withdraw all products from the manufacturing sites identified by the Department of Health. "Enterprise and Rainbow supply a very broad range of retailers across South Africa," said David North, Group Executive, Strategy and Corporate Affairs, Pick n Pay Stores. "All Enterprise products (including the  Bokkie, Renown, Lifestyle and Mieliekip brands) have already been recalled by the company concerned and we are urgently withdrawing them from our stores. In addition, all ready-to-eat products such as polony and russian sausages manufactured at the Rainbow facility in Sasolburg are also being withdrawn. "This action is taking place in all Pick n Pay and Boxer stores.  In addition, as a precaution, Pick n Pay branded chicken polony, manufactured by Rainbow, is also being withdrawn." The retail chain said that all fridges and food preparation areas in our stores will now be re-cleaned to prevent any cross-contamination. "Recalled meat is being isolated and will be safely destroyed," it added. "The safety of customers is always our top concern. Any customer who is concerned that they may have bought a ready-to-eat meat product linked to the outbreak can return it to our stores for a full refund." On Sunday, the Department of Trade and Industry (dti) issued a recall of all products from the Enterprise and Rainbow Chicken Limited companies, which have been found to have traces of Listeria.
