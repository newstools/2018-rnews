 Police in Tshwane have opened an inquest docket for investigation after an alleged armed robber was shot and killed by a Cartrack officer. According to police spokesperson, Capt Kay Makhubela, theÂ Tshwane Flying Squad received information to be on the lookout for a Toyota Hillux, which was taken in a house robbery in Mamelodi East. The vehicle was fitted with a Cartrack unit and was showing that it was in the Silverton area - Simon Vermooten Street close to the N4 east. "The police joined up with the vehicle of Cartrack and the vehicle was seen at Furrow Street parked in the shopping area. "When the suspect saw the police vehicle, he started running south in Simon Vermooten Street with a handgun in his hand and pressing the trigger but the gun did not fire," said Capt Makhubela. "The suspect was not shot at in fear hitting innocent road users and public. "The suspect did not see the Cartrack vehicle and when he entered a private property, Cartrack and the Flying Squad cornered him and he kept on pressing the trigger even cocking the pistol. "He was then fatally wounded by the tracker member." He said that police have since opened an inquest docket for investigation.
