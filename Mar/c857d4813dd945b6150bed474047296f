"Their arrest comes in the wake of ongoing investigations regarding alleged fraud and corruption in the Eastern Cape Municipalities after they allegedly flouted tender procedures during the course of 2014 to 2016 when four tenders valued at R37 million were unduly awarded to entities they had ties to, in return for apparent gratification,"said HAWKS Spokesperson, Captain Anelisa FeniÂ . "The court released the suspects on a warning and they are expected back at the same court on 25 May."
