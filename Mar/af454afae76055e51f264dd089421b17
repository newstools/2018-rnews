 No one is above the law and if Metro Police officers are caught transgressing the law they will be dealt with very harshly, the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality said on Monday. Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality Metro Police Chief, Yolande Faro, made this stringent statement following the arrest of an off-duty Metro Police officer for allegedly driving under the influence of alcohol. “There is no way we will tolerate this behaviour as Metro Police officers are entrusted to stop the carnage on our roads caused by drunken drivers, and not be responsible for endangering the lives of other road users like in this case. “I ordered the immediate suspension of the officer pending an investigation. “The arrest took place at 07:10 this morning, when Metro Police officers were patrolling Standford Road. They noticed a silver VW Polo indicating to turn into the roadway in front of the patrol car, while travelling in an IPTS bus lane. “Our officers switched on their siren to warn the driver against doing it, but when he foolhardily persisted, he was requested to pull over and eventually stopped his car in Liebenberg Road. “The driver of the patrol car was surprised when he recognized the offending driver as one of his colleagues. “They were especially alarmed when he reeked of alcohol and immediately informed him that his blood alcohol level will be tested. “The suspect jumped out of his car and ran a short distance before he was apprehended by his colleagues. “He was arrested and taken to the Gelvandale South African Police Services where he was charged for driving under the influence of alcohol “I am especially perturbed by this incident and the law must now take its course,” Metro Police Chief Faro said.
