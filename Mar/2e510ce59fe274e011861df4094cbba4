 The Eastern Cape’s Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (CoGTA) MEC, Fikile Xasa, has welcomed the arrest of 12 Mnquma Local Municipality officials on allegations of fraud, corruption and money laundering. “It is our hope that indeed 2018 will be the year in which we will turn the tide on acts of fraud, corruption and financial mismanagement in our public institutions. We commit to enhance and co-ordinate our anti-corruption efforts more effectively to expose and prosecute perpetrators without fear or favour,” said MEC Xasa. The officials, who are also alleged to have flouted the Municipal Finance Management Act (MFMA), appeared in the Butterworth Magistrate Court on Tuesday. They were released on warning and are set to appear in court again on 25 May 2018. MEC Xasa said law enforcement agencies such as the Hawks are critical to fighting corruption and restoring law and order at municipalities. “Likewise, we encourage municipal councils to implement the recommendations of forensic investigation reports at their disposal without fail. Working with law enforcement agencies, we will set up teams to follow up on such reports to ensure that the findings are effected,” said the MEC. He encouraged members of the public to continue to report acts of fraud and corruption to the Anti-Corruption Hotline 0800 701 701. – SAnews.gov.za
