 Two suspects are expected in court on Wednesday after they were arrested by members from the Mount Road Cluster Combatting Crime Unit with a stolen vehicle. According to police spokeperson, Col Priscilla Naidu, the two were arrested on Monday, at about 19:30, when officers noticed a navy blue Mazda 5 at the corners of Clyde and Rink Street in Central, Port Elizabeth. "As the occupants noticed them, they sped off. Backup was requested. "It is alleged that the driver lost control of the vehicle and collided into a tree," she added. "The driver attempted to run off but was apprehended. His passenger was also arrested." Col Naidu said that upon searching the vehicle, a 40 inch Samsung TV and a lap top was found in the boot of the car. "It was further established that the vehicle was stolen in King William’s Town in February 2018." The suspects, aged 23 and 33 years old, were detained on charges of possession of suspected stolen property. "The members worked an extra 5 hours over and above their normal 12 hour shift in order to ensure that the suspects were safely behind bars," she said. Acting Cluster Commander for Mount Road, Brigadier Andrew Louw, commended the commitment and dedication of the members. “In adhering to the Back to Basics approach of policing, actions such as this shows that our members are committed to rendering a professional service to the community,” added Brig Louw.
