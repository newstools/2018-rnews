 The African National Congress (ANC) Joint Study Group on Justice and Correctional Services and Police on Wednesday said that it is concerned about the slow progress made by the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) in finalising and prosecuting State Capture cases. "Having noted the input by the NPA and Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (DPCI) at the Joint Portfolio Committee meeting earlier today, challenges regarding the prosecution of State Capture cases must be addressed, and must be prosecuted," said Spokesperson, Nonceba Mhlauli. "We are of the view that the Acting Head of the DPCI Lieutenant General Yolisa Matakata, should be offered an opportunity to respond to the presentation made by the National Director of Public Prosecutions (NDPP), Adv. Shaun Abrahams, in a follow up meeting regarding the reasons for the lack of progress on State Capture investigations and prosecutions. "We urge the NPA and the DPCI to work together in solving priority crimes in South Africa, especially economic and commercial crimes such as money laundering. Both these two entities will be requested to come back to Parliament to give an update on efforts made to empower cooperation between the NPA and DPCI."
