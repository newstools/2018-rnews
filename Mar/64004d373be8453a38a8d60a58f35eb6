 Seven German students in their 20s were found safe in Port Alfred after they had failed to arrive at their lodge at the expected time. According to Juan Pretorius, National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) Port Alfred station commander, at 19h00, on Tuesday, the NSRI Port Alfred duty crew was activated following reports from a paddle craft hire company of seven German students overdue after being expected to arrive at their destination up river on the Kowie River. "The seven students - four females and three males, aged in their early 20's, all attending a local university, had hired paddle craft to paddle upstream in an incoming tide to overnight at a game lodge, but they had failed to arrive as expected and their luggage had been delivered earlier by road," he said. "Our sea rescue craft Rescue 11 Alpha was launched and following a search they were found safe about 1.5 kilometers past their intended destination, about 14 kilometers upstream. "It appears that as night fell they had gone past their intended destination and staff at the lodge concerned had raised the alarm. "We took them onboard our sea rescue craft, rafted the 4 paddle craft to the sea rescue craft, and transported them to the lodge without incident where staff were waiting to receive them and once safely delivered to their destination no further assistance was required."
