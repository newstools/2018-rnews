 The Mdantsane Regional Court on Wednesday sentenced a 34-year-old man, Lwandiso Sibene, to 25 years imprisonment for killing his stepmother. According to a police spokesperson, Nkosikho Mzuko, the incident happened at a home in Mdantsane NU15, East London, in July last year. “He was found guilty by the court of strangling his stepmother and stabbing her to death five times in the neck after a lengthy argument," Mzuku said. "The investigating officer presented a thoroughly investigated docket before the Magistrate, that led to this hefty sentence." Mdantsane Cluster Commander, Major General Henry Vos, said that he was pleased with the sentence, and further condemned violence against woman and children. "I hope this sentence will be a good lesson to those who are still disrespecting women and children," he said.
