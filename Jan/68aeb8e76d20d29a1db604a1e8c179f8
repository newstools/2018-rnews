 For anyone interested, the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality's procurement meetings are actually open to the public. "The Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality took a decision during 2016 to open Bid Adjudication Committee (BAC) Meetings to the public," explained Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality Executive Mayor, Athol Trollip. "This decision was taken to promote and enhance transparency in our procurement processes as entrenched in the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa." The Mayor said that all BAC meetings will be held in the Boardroom, Supply Chain Management, Harrower Road, on Fridays at 09:00. "The agenda will be published on the Municipal Website on the day preceding the meeting." NOTE: The status of any person other than the Committee Members will be that of an observer.
