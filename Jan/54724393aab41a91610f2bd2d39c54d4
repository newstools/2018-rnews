 Disgraced former Eskom CEO, Brian Molefe, was on Thursday ordered by the High Court in Pretoria to pay back the R11 million that he got as part of his R30 million pension payout from the power utility. Molefe, who is credited with ending loadshedding when he took over at Eskom, however left the utility a few years later after he was implicated in former Public Protector, Thuli Madonsela's State of Capture report. The High Court said that the allegations against him were the reasons for his resignation - after he famously cried at a media briefing over the allegations, and ruled that the allegations were highly relevant to Molefe’s suitability for reinstatement and were a dead weight that he must carry until he is cleared. The court unanimously found that because Molefe resigned, he was never entitled to pension money. He must now pay back the R11 million already received in 2016 within 10 days. The Hgh Court ruling follows an application by trade union, Solidarity to declare as unlawful the controversial pension award of around R30 million granted to Molefe. Molefe had opposed the application, insisted that he never resigned and that if his pension was revoked, he should be reinstated as Eskom CEO. image: Youtube video screengrab of Brian Molefe crying after being implicated in State Capture.
