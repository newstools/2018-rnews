 The case against a 33-year-old man accused of killing his missing girlfriend and dumping her body in a pit toilet was postponed to the 8th of February when the man appeared before the Willowvale Magistrate's Court on Monday. Lundi Magagu was not asked to plead to the murder charge before he was remanded in custody pending further police investigations. His murdered girlfriend has since been identified as Lulama Nkumanda, also aged 33. "The suspect was arrested on Friday at Mndundu Village, in Willowvale," said police spokesperson, Captain Jackson Manatha. "It is alleged that the deceased was last seen on Tuesday - 2 January, leaving a tavern with the suspect, her boyfriend. "The deceased was never seen again." He said that she was reported as a missing person at Willowvale Police Station. "Police looked all over with negative results. "Willowvale police detectives then questioned the suspect and he co-operated with them," said Captain Manatha. "The suspect led the police to a pit toilet at Mndundu Village, in Willowvale, where the body of the deceased was found." Eastern Cape SAPS Police Provincial Commissioner, Lt Gen Liziwe Ntshinga, condemned the murder of a defenceless woman. She congratulated Willowvale police for the arrest.
