 Civil rights organisation, AfriForum, is going after the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) and its leaders for the vandalism that happened at several H&M stores across Johannesburg over the weekend. AfriForum said that they will be filing charges of incitement to public violence against EFF leaders, Julius Malema, Floyd Shivambu and Mbuyiseni Ndlozi at 1pm on Monday. This is after several people wearing EFF t-shirts were seen vandalising H&M Stores at shopping centres in Menlyn and Midrand as well as in Sandton. They were protesting against a controversial H&M advert that surfaced online last week in which a black child is seen wearing a hoodie with the words: ‘Coolest monkey in the jungle’. The advert, which has since been removed, also attracted widespread condemnation across the world and from black celebrities like Puff Daddy. Apparently, the hoodie has also been withdrawn from shelves in UK stores‚ where it was on sale. H&M has 17 stores in South Africa, which have been closed until further notice. The company has apologised for the offence caused by the advert. Gauteng police are yet to arrest anyone for the weekend vanadalism. Photo credit: Sarah Koning
