 Police in Humansdorp has launched a manhunt for three suspects, who allegedly robbed a small business and assaulted the 55-year-old male complainant on Thursday night. According to police spokesperson, Captain Gerda Swart; “It is alleged that the complainant went outside his home (a small holding outside Humansdorp), on Thursday, at about 22:00, to switch off the generator. “He was suddenly approached by three male suspects, who threatened him with a knife and attacked him with knobkerries. The suspects ushered the man into his small shop and tied him up.” She said they then loaded items onto the complainant’s white 2007 Isuzu double cab, forced the complainant into the bakkie and drove towards the direction of Humansdorp.  “The suspects then dropped the complainant, who was severely assaulted, next to the road. The complainant managed to alert a community member, who assisted him to be admitted to a local hospital,” Capt Swart added.  “Police were notified and SAPS Humansdorp is investigating a case of business robbery, but more charges will follow as the investigation continues.” She said Detectives from Humansdorp SAPS are following up on all possible leads with the assistance of the local criminal record centre.   The Station Commander of Humansdorp, Colonel Simon Swarts, said: “A dedicated team of seasoned officials were set up to follow up on all possible leads and they will work determinedly to bring those responsible to book”.
