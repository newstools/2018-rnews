 The Democratic Alliance (DA) in the Free State on Wednesday claimed that it had been approached by several sources within the Free State Department of Police, Roads and Transport, who claim an instruction was issued to close all department offices so that officials may attend the memorial and funeral of the late HOD, Sandile Msibi, who passed away last month, in Parys on Thursday and on Saturday. "Traffic on our roads will increase exponentially as most holiday makers will be returning to their homes this weekend. We cannot allow that resources are diverted at a time when they are needed most," said Leona Kleynhans - a DA Member of the Provincial Legislature. "The DA urges MEC Sam Mashinini to intervene and ensure that traffic law enforcement operations will not be negatively affected this week. "We will also submit written questions to him once the Legislature reconvenes to ascertain how such a directive has impacted on the operations of the department, but specifically that of traffic law enforcement. "We would like to know how many traffic vehicles and traffic officials were diverted from operations to attend the memorial and funeral and what the financial implications were." Kleynhans said that while the party's sympathy goes out to the Msibi Family for their loss, the DA is concerned that the closure of department offices, "especially those for traffic law enforcement, will severely hamper efforts to ensure the safety of motorists through the monitoring and enforcement of traffic laws".
