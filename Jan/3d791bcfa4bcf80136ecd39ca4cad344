 The Democratic Alliance (DA) in the Free State on Wednesday said that it had been shocked to learn of an allegation made public by Free State Premier, Ace Magashule, at the funeral of the late HOD for the Department of Police, Roads and Transport, Sandile Msibi, that he was poisoned and that it is suspected that this was the cause of his death. "Ever the master of grand-standing, Premier Magashule could not resist the temptation to make such a serious allegation public at the most inappropriate venue and time when loved ones are in mourning at a funeral," said Dr Roy Jankielsohn - Leader of the DA in the Free State Provincial Legislature. "The DA cannot allow such a serious allegation to go unchallenged. "In view of Premier Magashuleâ€™s announcement, the DA will submit written questions to the Office of the Premier once the Free State Legislature re-opens. "We would like to know whether an autopsy was performed to confirm poisoning and whether a case of murder has been reported to the SAPS for further investigation." Dr Jankielsohn added that allegations involving the poisoning of individuals operating within the structures of the state "are extremely serious and if are found to be true, has serious implications on the integrity of the state and the ability of government to ensure effective service delivery as it is constitutionally mandated to do".
