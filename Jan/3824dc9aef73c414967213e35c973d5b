 Two suspects are expected to appear in court on Thursday after they were arrested following a police car chase on the N2 highway after authorities received intelligence that the duo were transporting a large consignment of dagga towards Port Elizabeth. "This followed after Kinkelbos police were waiting to spot the vehicle, a silver Ford Figo, on the N2 after information was received about it transporting dagga," said police spokesperson, Captain Andre Beetge. "On spotting it at 14:40, and the vehicle refusing to pull over, a short vehicle chase ensued up to the R335 turn off bridge near Coega where the vehicle was blocked off by Motherwell Cluster Highway Patrol at 14:55." He said that six large bales of dagga were found in the vehicle and two male suspects, aged 49 and 38 years old, were arrested. "The six bales weighing between 16 and 20 kilogram each with a total weight of just over 100 kilogram and estimated street value of about R250 000 was handed in at Swartkops police station where the case of dealing in dagga was opened," said Captain Beetge. "Both suspects will appear in the Motherwell Magistrate's Court on Thursday on charges of dealing in dagga."
