 Police officers attached to the SAPS K9 Breede River Unit conducted an operation at a suspected drug outlet at a flat in W Riverview, Worcester. "When the premises were searched one of the members spotted a small cupboard against the wall and it seemed that it had a false compartment," said police spokesperson, Captain FC Van Wyk. "He used a screwdriver to open the compartment. Inside he found 60g tik, 334 tik straws, 289 Mandrax tablets, 74 tik lollies and an undisclosed amount of cash." Captain Van Wyk said that the total value of the seizure was R34Â 438-90. "A 36-year-old woman was arrested for possession of drugs. "She is expected to appear in the Worcester Magistrates' Court soon on the said charges," he added. "The abuse of illegal substances is one of the root causes of violent crime, and the members of K9 are lauded for their efforts to take drugs off our streets."
