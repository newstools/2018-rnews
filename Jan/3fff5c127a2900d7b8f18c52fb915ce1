 The Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality on Thursday said that reports that its tap water is one of the causes of the outbreak of Listeriosis within Nelson Mandela Bay, are unfounded. "[We] can confirm that the water coming out of our taps is safe to drink. The Municipality's drinking water preparation and distribution complies with South African National Standards 241," described Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality Mayoral Committee Member for Infrastructure and Engineering, Masixole Zinto. "The institution would like to condemn individuals, who have been spreading inaccurate and irresponsible information about this serious issue through social media. "This misinformation has not only caused panic across the City, it has also led to undue pressure on our Service Delivery Call Centre, which we use to deal with water leaks among others."  Zinto said that, as correctly communicated by the Department of Health, people are requested to adhere to the strictest hygienic living conditions during this time. "The Department of Health, working with the National Institute for Communicable Diseases, is leading the disease control programme," he said. "Any formal communication about the disease will be done by either the Provincial or National Department of Health." On Wednesday, it emerged that nine cases of Listeriosis had been confimed in the Nelson Mandela Bay, with one fatality. In December, the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality said that two cases of meningitis had been linked to the national listeriosis disease outbreak. In January, Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi, said that over 700 Listeriosis cases have been confirmed in the country and the disease, which is preventable and treatable, has so far claimed the lives of 67 people.
