 A 31-year-old man, who was arrested by Butterworth police for the alleged rape of a 22-year-old woman, last week, briefly appeared before the Butterworth Magistrate's Court on Tuesday morning. "He was not asked to plead," said police spokesperson, Captain Jackson Manatha. "The case of the accused was postponed to next week Tuesday for further investigation. "The accused was remanded in custody as he was not granted bail." Captain Manatha said that the accused cannot be named until he pleads to the charge against him.  It is alleged that the victim was from a traditional ceremony on Friday, at about 03:20. She was on her way home when she came across the suspect at Mqambeli Locality, Bawa Village, Butterworth. "The victim requested the suspect to accompany her to her home. The suspect agreed but when they nearer the home of the victim, the suspect was aggressive saying that he cannot just accompany her. "He demanded to have sex with the victim," said Captain Manatha. "When the victim refused, she was severely assaulted and dragged to a nearby forest where she was allegedly raped." He added said that the suspect later forced the victim to go to his home where they slept until the morning. "The victim was then allowed to go home." A case of rape was later registered at Butterworth Police Station. "Police acted swiftly as they traced the suspect and arrested him." Butterworth Cluster Police has been warning the community to end the traditional ceremonies around 17:00 to avoid crime.
