 Eight men, who were arrested on Saturday for the allegedly illegal possession of an unlicensed firearm and stolen goods, will appear at New Brighton Magistrate’s Court on Monday. According to a police spokesperson, Captain Andre Beetge, Motherwell and Kwazakele, in Port Elizabeth, police were conducting special operations when they arrested the men. “The first incident was along the M17 road, in Kwazakhele, at about 19:30, where four suspects, aged 22 and 28 years old, were arrested after a rifle with four rounds ammunition was found in their vehicle,” he described. “Another incident transpired when a VW Gold drove off on the M17 after members of the Operational Command Centre (OCC) signalled it to stop. They chased it until it pulled over at Njoli Square. “The vehicle was searched and four suspects aged 26 - 30 were arrested after a suspected stolen plasma TV was found with them in the vehicle.” Motherwell Cluster Commander, Major General Dawie Rabie, said that he was pleased with the arrests. “Crimes committed with firearms as well as possession of stolen property will continue to have the focus of the SAPS,” he added.
