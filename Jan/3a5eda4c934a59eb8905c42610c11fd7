 With media reports suggesting that up to 50,000 agents may be operating without the required Fidelity Fund Certificate (FFC). The real figure is likely to be a lot less in that many former agents have probably just closed up shop in the last 10 years, but even so there is a chance that the agent, who sold or rented out your house for you is (whether inadvertently or by design) unregistered. Using an unregistered agent... For most of us the best advice is to rather err on the side of caution.Â  Check for registration, and in any doubt ask your lawyer for help before agreeing to anything.
