 Looking for affordable Cape Town office space, in a convenient, friendly and supportive environment? Non-profit trust Inyathelo, The South African Institute for Advancement, has 13.9m², 3.44 m² and 11.05m² available for rent. The office space is located in Woodstock’s trendy Buchanan Square, formerly a textile factory that was renovated according to strict heritage guidelines. Inyathelo offers light-filled, fully-furnished space in The Armoury section, where several creative industries and other businesses are located. Operations Director Feryal Domingo says: “Our tenants are mainly non-government organisations (NGOs), but we also welcome for-profit companies. "We offer facilities such as uncapped internet, a book lounge and meeting pods, as well as training rooms. Parking is negotiable. The warm and welcoming space, and the friendly people you meet every day, are what really set us apart from other, more sterile working environments.”
