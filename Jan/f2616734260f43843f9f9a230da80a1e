 Eastern Cape police said that they are concerned by incidents where communities still take the law into their own hands following an incident of mob justice that happened in Motherwell, Port Elizabeth. According to police information, it is alleged that two jikeleza (or township taxi) drivers, who were best friends, had an argument along Sisulu Street, NU30, Motherwell, which led to the murder of one of them. "Mabuti Maya (34) was allegedly stabbed in his chest by his best friend, Bulelani Ndalambu (28) after arguing over jikeleza taxi fare money,” police said. "Shortly after the stabbing, the community gathered and chased after Bulelani and out of revenge, killed him by setting him alight.” Police condemned the incident. “Violent and unlawful behavior will not be tolerated. We urge the community to stand together and stop these illegal activities. There is no justification for taking the law into their own hands and under no circumstances will we allow this to happen,” said Eastern Cape SAPS Provincial Commissioner, Lt Gen Liziwe Ntshinga. "Those responsible for the murder will be arrested and brought before the court.”
