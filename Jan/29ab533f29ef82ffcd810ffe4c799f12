 The 'unbearable litter and filth' in the Buffalo City Metro (BCM) is a legacy of ongoing African National Congress (ANC) mismanagement and looting, the Democratic Alliance (DA) in the Buffalo City Metro said on Thursday. "Duncan Village is overflowing with garbage and over Christmas, the King William’s Town CBD looked more like a combat zone than an economic hub of the Metro," described Vaughan Holmes, DA Caucus Chairperson for the Buffalo City Metro. "Filthy conditions have also given rise to a plague of rats in Vincent and Duncan Village and is a threat to public health." Holmes said that the DA is calling on the ANC-led municipality to urgently enforce the existing bylaws properly by supplying enough bins for public access and to clamp down on littering and illegal rubbish dumps. "The municipality must furthermore ensure that bins are maintained, water and animal proofed and emptied and cleansed when full. The municipality must also, as stated by the solid waste bylaws, supply waste recycling services. Very little has been done to comply," he added. "The Metro must take lessons from well-governed DA-led municipalities in the Western Cape where solid waste is separated at source and recycling and waste minimization actually works on an organised scale. "Under a DA-administration, scarce public resources would be spent on basic service delivery and the Metro will be cleaned up as a matter of urgency."
