 A 24-year-old will be appearing in court on Wednesday after Bethelsdorp police officers found drugs and an illegal firearm in his pocket on Tuesday morning. According to police spokesperson, Col Priscilla Naidu, the police were patrolling in Esterhuizen Street, Arcadia, when they arrested the suspect, who seemed rather dubious. “It is alleged that when the suspect spotted the police, he started to move into a garage. Members reacted immediately and went after the suspect,” Colonel Naidu described. “The suspect took out a firearm, a black revolver from his pocket and threw it behind him. On searching the suspect, the members found four mandrax tablets; two packets of khat; six packets of tik and cash in his pocket. “The suspect was detained on charges of illegal possession of a firearm, illegal possession of ammunition and dealing in drugs.” The suspect will appear in court on Wednesday. “Firearms and drugs are known to be the biggest crime generators within the communities, therefore, we will be resolute in fighting the scourge of illicit sale of drugs as well as a proliferation of illegal firearms. This is the 10th firearm that was confiscated since last week,” commented Maj Gen Thembisile Patekile, Cluster Commander for the SAPS’ Mount Road Cluster. “The prevalence of drugs and firearms in the communities is a concern and we will not rest until these drug pedlars/traffickers are arrested and their trade ruined permanently.”
