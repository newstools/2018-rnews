Their cell phones were taken at gunpoint by two suspects," said police spokesperson, Col Priscilla Naidu. "The taxi driver offered his assistance and later in the evening picked up the two victims and drove around the area looking for the suspects. "After a while, the taxi driver dropped them off as suspects could not be found." She said that about an hour later, the taxi driver returned to the victims a with one suspect, a toy gun and a cell phone. "Police was summoned and the victims recognised the suspect and the cell phone. "The other suspect and cell phone is still missing," added Col Naidu.
