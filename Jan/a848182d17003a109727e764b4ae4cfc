 Motherwell SAPS Cluster Commander, Major General Dawie Rabie, on Monday appealed to the residents of Motherwell, Ikamvelihle, Kwazakele, New Brighton and Kwadwesi to stop taking the law in their hands, warning that vigilante attacks will not be tolerated. “Murder and assault are against the law and all persons committing such acts will face prosecution and will be arrested and brought before the court," he said. The warning comes after another incident where the residents of Kwadwesi severely assaulted a 32-year-old man and a 15-year-old boy, whom they accused of breaking into a house and stealing a Plasma TV. “Fortunately, the SAPS Public Order Police Unit came to rescue before the two males were seriously hurt or killed,” said police spokesperson, Captain Andre Beetge. “The 32-year-old male had to receive medical attention from a hospital. “However, none of the community came forward to explain where the males had allegedly stolen a TV, and no housebreaking cases were opened that could be linked to this incident.” General Rabie urged communities to approach the police when they suspect that a crime has been committed. “The SAPS wishes to invite communities to be vigilant and come forward with information when crimes are committed in order for the SAPS to investigate and arrest the perpetrators of crime. “We are also encouraging our communities to document their property serial numbers including TVs and plasma screens, or to alternatively mark their property with marks only they could recognise,” he added. “Cell phone owners should also keep their phone IMEI numbers in a safe place to assist in tracing and identifying their phones if stolen or robbed. IMEI numbers can be accessed by typing *#06#. "Be vigilant, stay safe and assist the police in fighting crime in your area."
