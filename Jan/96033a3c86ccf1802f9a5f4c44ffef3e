"The Maryke and three other fishing vessels had reportedly begun a search." She said that the sea rescue craft Spirit of St Francis II was launched and on arrival on the scene joined in a search and assisted in sweeping line search patterns and just after 08h00 an SA Air Force's 15 Squadron Charlie Flight helicopter, with two NSRI Port Elizabeth rescue swimmers aboard, joined the search operation and NSRI St Francis Bay crew and SA National Park rangers searched along the shoreline.
