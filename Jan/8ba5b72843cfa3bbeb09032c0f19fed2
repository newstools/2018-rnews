 The Democratic Alliance (DA) on Friday said that while it congratulates the Matric class of 2017, it is 'deeply concerned by the truly shocking' dropout figures that put the real Matric pass rate at 37.3%, when the pass rate is calculated from the Grade 10 class of 2015, who then passed their final school exams in 2017. "Only 49.7% of Grade 10s actually wrote the final NSC exams and a startling 37.3% of 2015’s Grade 10 learners actually passed. This means that over 62.7% of Grade 10s did not pass, dropped out or become stuck in the system – sometimes as a result of purposeful action by school leaders," said Nomsa Marchesi MP - DA Shadow Deputy Minister of Basic Education. "The situation has worsened from last year’s real pass rate of 40.2% - suggesting that our schooling system is not a ‘system on the rise’ as claimed. "The ‘real’ pass rates for each province highlights a dire situation which means that learners will not be able to enter post-school education or job market this year."   Class of 2017 Province Gr 10 (2015) Wrote NSC (2017) % Grade 10 (2015) who wrote NSC Passed NSC NSC pass rate (%) ‘Real' pass rate (%) Eastern Cape 154 774 67 648 43.7 43978 65.0 28.4 Free State 59 613 25 130 42.2 21613 86.0 36.3 Gauteng 170 844 97 284 56.9 82753 85.1 48.4 KwaZulu-Natal 248 347 124 317 50.1 90587 72.9 36.5 Limpopo 187 001 83 228 44.5 54621 65.6 29.2 Mpumalanga 93 095 48 483 52.1 36273 74.8 39.0 North West 68 464 30 792 45.0 24462 79.4 35.7 Northern Cape 20 180 8 735 43.3 6607 75.6 32.7 Western Cape 72 428 48 867 67.5 40440 82.8 55.8 National 1 074 746 534 484 49.7 401334 75.1 37.3   Marchesi said that the DA-run Western Cape again tops the ‘real’ results table, with the lowest dropout rate in the country. "The Free State, which topped this year’s Matric exams results, has the highest dropout rate of all the provinces. When you take this into account, the real pass rate for the Free State is only 36.3% - raising serious concerns about allegations that learners are being ‘culled’ from the system in order to preserve good matric pass rates," she added. "The DA has repeatedly called for an investigation into the high dropout rate and specifically ‘culling’. Yet, Basic Education Minister, Angie Motshekga, has refused to even consider the issue of culling, contradicting her Deputy Director-General who confirmed last year that these practices were taking place. "The Minister cannot stick her head in the sand on this issue when the future of thousands of learners are at stake. Motshekga must explain why she consistently refuses to institute an investigation into culling when this means that more than half of Grade 10s do not pass their final Matric exams, making it less likely that they will be able to further their education or find a job."
