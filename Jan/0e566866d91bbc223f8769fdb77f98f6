 Two suspects are expected in court soon after they were arrested by Port Elizabeth police in Colchester for dealing in dagga following a high-speed chase on Wednesday morning. According to a police spokesperson, Captain Andre Beetge, a white VW Gold refused to stop on the N2 close to Kinkelbos police station when the driver was instructed to do so, which led to a high-speed chase conducted by the SAPS. “At about 06:40 the Golf swerved to avoid a collision with another vehicle crossing the N2 at the Petrol garage at Colchester,” he described. Capt Beetge said that the driver lost control of the vehicle and collided with a stationary truck next to the N2. “Both suspects, aged 37 and 26 years, were arrested for dealing in dagga after three large bales of dagga was found in the Golf. “The 26-year-old passenger was taken to hospital under police guard for minor fractures and injuries while the 37-year-old driver is in detention at Kinkelbos,” he described. He added that the total weight of dagga is 115kg with an estimated street value of R350 000. The Motherwell Cluster Commander, Major General Dawie Rabie, applauded the arrests and assured the Nelson Mandela Bay residents that "SAPS continues to strive to get drugs off the streets and ensure a safer environment for our communities."
