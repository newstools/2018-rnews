 Frustrating traffic congestion in St Francis Street in Jeffreys Bay, in particular during peak times, may soon be a thing of the past, with upgrades planned on the stretch between the Koraal and Nautilus Street intersections. The work, a joint effort by Kouga Municipality, the East Cape Department of Roads and Public Works and AfriForum Jeffreys Bay, has already seen left slip lanes being added at the Koraal Street and Disa Avenue junctions. Executive Mayor Elza van Lingen said the lanes were a temporary measure to ease the flow of traffic for the current holiday season. “Two traffic circles will be constructed in the new year, one at the Koraal intersection and another at the Nautilus intersection in front of Wavelands Caltex. Road users have often complained that these two intersections cause major delays in traffic,” she said. She said a thorough Traffic Impact Assessment (TIA) had been done, following which AES Engineering was appointed by AfriForum to do detailed designs, expected by mid-January 2018. Van Lingen said an extra lane for cars turning from Disa Avenue, into St Francis Street towards town, would also be created. “Being stuck on the road in hot weather while holidaying or being delayed for work can spoil one’s day altogether. We do, however, still want to caution that we are not opening a leeway for reckless driving and we will come down heavily on offenders,” she said. Ward councillor Hattingh Bornman said the ward committee of ward 11 was in full support of the project and had resolved to contribute the R100 000 ward allocation to the project. The Mayor thanked AfriForum for their role in the upgrade. “It is always a great thing to see civic organisations getting involved in projects that advance the cause of our towns and for the benefit of all. We hope others will be inspired and, together, we will make Kouga great,” she said.
