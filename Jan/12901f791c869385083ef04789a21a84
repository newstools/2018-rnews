 The strike action at the University of South Africa (Unisa) has been called off with immediate effect following a protracted salary negotiation process, which commenced in August 2017. An agreement facilitated by the CCMA in terms of Section 150 of the Labour Relations Act, as amended, was reached on Friday 26 January 2018. This process has been conducted taking into account the financial situation of the university and the realities experienced by the sector. The situation has been compounded by various factors affecting the fiscus as well as uncertainty linked to policy changes within the sector.  The latest fee-free higher education is yet to be clearer in terms of this impact later this year. Against this backdrop, it is clear that the negotiations remained challenging.  Consequently, Unisa continues to seek an optimal balance amongst these demanding challenges to ensure institutional agility and efficacy. In terms of the collective agreement signed by the parties, permanent and fixed-term employees will receive a differentiated salary increase of 7.5% and a special dispensation for the insourced employees. The Principal and Vice-Chancellor, Professor Mandla Makhanya, thanks, Unisa staff for their continued commitment and patience during this period.
