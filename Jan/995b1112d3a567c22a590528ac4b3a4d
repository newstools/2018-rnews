 New police Constables, who graduated from the police training academies two weeks ago are already showing their mettle and zest for what they have been trained to do – protect and serve the citizens of this country. On Friday, two Constables were engaged in intensive stop and search operations in Bethelsdorp, Port Elizabeth, when they arrested a suspect with 30 mandrax tablets, nine packets of tik and cash. "The estimated street value of the drugs is R2 000," said police spokesperson, Capt Sandra Janse van Rensburg. "The same members, while on patrol also recovered a hijacked VW Golf abandoned in Kwanoxolo." Capt Janse van Rensburg said that the vehicle was hijacked in Uitenhage.  The Station Commander of SAPS Bethelsdorp, Brig Zolani Xawuka, has praised the new Constables for their efforts during this busy festive season.
