 The Northern Cape Provincial Department of Transport, Safety and liaison's IT Assistant Director, Dennis Peterson (41), appeared before the Kimberley Magistrate’s Court for alleged procurement corruption on Wednesday after he was arrested by the Hawks on the same day. "The Hawks’ Serious Corruption Crime unit led investigations started in June 2017, regarding the alleged violation of the procurement process dating back to April 2016," said police spokesperson, Captain Philani Nkwalase. "It is alleged that three quotations were sourced from different IT service providers. "However, a specific company was contacted later to resubmit a revised quote and was ultimately awarded a tender valued at just over R38 000, following which a gratification was allegedly paid to Peterson." Capt Nkwalase said that the implicated company’s owner, Mosimanegape Victor Motaung (38), was also arrested separately and appeared in the same court. "Both accused have been released on R3 000 bail each and the case has been postponed to 16 February 2018 pending further investigations."
