 Port Elizabeth police arrested 86 people during Special Operations that were conducted over the weekend in Motherwell, Swartkops, Ikamvelihle, Kwazakele, New Brighton and Kwadwesi. According to a police spokesperson, Captain Andre Beetge, 58 of the arrests were for drunk driving while 28 suspects were arrested for possession of drugs including dagga, mandrax and tik. “Some of these operations focused on drunk driving and possession of drugs and have ensured the arrests of 86 suspects,” Captain Beetge added. The Motherwell Cluster Commander, Major General Dawie Rabie, has applauded these arrests and added that "drunk driving is just the result of other problems such as alcohol abuse”. “Alcohol and drug abuse are one of the base generators of other crimes such as assault, murder, rape and domestic violence,” he added. “The SAPS will continue to show zero tolerance towards alcohol and drug-related crimes.”
