 The All Saints Detective Academy, supported by Liberty Life and Department of Correctional Services, on Friday donated school uniforms and sanitary pads to learners at the Sakuphumelela High School as part of the SAPS National Police Day celebrations. The National Police Day usually takes off on the 27 January. Welcoming the police and guests was School Governing Body Member, Mr Hanisi. “Learners need more than uniform as they encounter many challenges; your input as SAPS is vital to communities. We hope that your assistance will also touch other needy learners. It is important that our kids grow up in conducive environments,” he said. Liberty Life Regional Manager, Mr Booi, said that he was proud to be associated with the initiative and he encouraged other Departments to identify and support needy communities. According to Colonel Sibongile Soci, the sanitary towels were given to all female learners, who were present, each getting three packs. Department of Education Circuit Manager, Mr Stamper said that all those, who are ready to assist someone else are the real fighters of the nation. “The collaboration between SAPS and Department of Education is symbolic of Madiba’s vision for the people of SA. “This event marks the first event to celebrate Madiba’s centenary celebrations. When u receive a gift, u should pay back – all the beneficiaries today must perform above 60% from now on. The parents will also be monitored closely to offer any support required,” he added. Colonel Soci said that an ex-offender motivated the learners emphasizing that learners must stay away from crime and focus on your studies. “Make a better choice for your lives because tomorrow you might regret it. Parents, support your kids so much that they don’t feel/see the need to commit crime. Encourage parents to visit and love their kids even if they are at correctional centers,” he said. School Principal, Mr Poswayo thanked everyone, who contributed to the donation.
