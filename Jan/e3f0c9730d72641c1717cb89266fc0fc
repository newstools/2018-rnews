 The United Democratic Movement (UDM) has welcomed reports that there will soon be an arrest warrant issued for, apparently, one of the Gupta brothers, and called for the net to be widened. “Seemingly the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) has woken up to its duty as it was reported that they were looking to seize Gupta assets and those of Trillian and McKinsey,” said Bongani Msomi, UDM Secretary General. “Even though the Hawks have now refuted claims of impending arrest of one of the Gupta brothers, it is time for them to prove that the South African public has reason to have faith in their ability to do their jobs and that they are also not captured.” Msomi said that the UDM, however, urges the NPA to widen its net and make sure that any members of the Executive, who have in some shape or form facilitated deals with the Gupta family are also thoroughly investigated. “Should the Hawks find any culprits, they must also face they music.”
