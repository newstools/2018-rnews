 Nelson Mandela Bay political parties will have another chance to go at it again in a municipal ward by-election that is scheduled for Wednesday, 7 March 2018. The Metro's Ward 1, with 13 061 registered voters, was represented by the Democratic Alliance (DA) and became vacant as a result of the somewhat unceremonious dismissal of former Councillor, Rashied Adams, from the party. The DA in the Metro said that failure to pay his membership fee is what led to Adams' expulsion. Some Ward 1 residents said then that they felt cheated by Adams and would demand answers from him. "Voting stations listed below will be open this Saturday, 20 January 2018, and Sunday, 21 January 2018, from 08h00 to 17h00to allow all eligible voters to register and for current voters to check their registration details and to provide/update address details where necessary," the IEC said in a statement. "Eligible voters should take their identity document (ID) with them – either a green barcoded ID book, a smartcard ID, or a valid Temporary ID Certificate. They will also need to complete their physical home address on registration or provide sufficient particularities of their place of residence. Documented proof of address (e.g. a municipal account) is not required." It said that voters may also check and update their details at their local (municipal) Electoral Commission (IEC) office weekdays during office hours. The IEC also reminded voters that it is a criminal offence to register and vote in a ward in which they are not ordinarily resident. Registration and voting will take place at the following stations: Voting District/Station Number Voting Station Details 10250019 CHESHIRE HOMES 10250064 MANCE KARATE CLUB 10460089 RIVERSIDE TENT 10460090 ELUKHOLWENI FARM SCHOOL  "Special voting will take place at voting stations as well as through home visits on 6 March 2018 between 08h00 and 17h00.

"Applications for special votes can also be made online via the IEC’s website, www.elections.org.za. Once voters have applied online they will receive an SMS notifying them of the outcome when their application has been processed.
