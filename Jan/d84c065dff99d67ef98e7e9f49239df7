 Our city is not a dumpsite, so it should not be treated as such; illegal dumping is a crime, Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality Executive Mayor, Athol Trollip, warned over the weekend. "You can only dispose of waste at municipal transfer sites. Construction/builders rubble can only be disposed of at Koedoeskloof and Arlington Landfill Sites," the Mayor added. "The Metro will be launching a covert, rapid response illegal dumping task force over the next few weeks." He said that this will be a joint operation between Public Health and Safety & Security, led by the respective mayoral committee members, Cllr Lance Grootboom and Cllr John Best. "If you dump illegally, this illegal dumping task force will catch you. Consider this a fair warning." He said that details regarding contact and tip-off options will be communicated in due course.
