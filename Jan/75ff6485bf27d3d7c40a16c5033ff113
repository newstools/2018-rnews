 A 31-year-old man is expected in court after he was arrested by Butterworth police for the alleged rape of a 22-year-old woman. "It is alleged that the victim was from a traditional ceremony on Friday, at about 03:20. She was on her way home when she came across the suspect at Mqambeli Locality, Bawa Village, Butterworth," described police spokesperson, Captain Jackson Manatha. "The victim requested the suspect to accompany her to her home. The suspect agreed but when they nearer the home of the victim, the suspect was aggressive saying that he cannot just accompany her. "He demanded to have sex with the victim. "When the victim refused, she was severely assaulted and dragged to a nearby forest where she was allegedly raped." Captain Manatha said that the suspect later forced the victim to go to his home where they slept until the morning. "The victim was then allowed to go home." A case of rape was later registered at Butterworth Police Station. "Police acted swiftly as they traced the suspect and arrested him."
