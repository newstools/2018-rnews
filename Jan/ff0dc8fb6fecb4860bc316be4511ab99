 A 23-year-old robber, Phikolomzi Sonakele, who is among four dangerous convicts, who escaped from the Mdantsane Correctional Facility last week, was re-arrested by Vulindlela police on Friday. Sonakele will soon appear before the Mdantsane Magistrate’s Court for an additional charge of escaping from lawful custody. According to police spokesperson, Captain Nkosikho Mzuku, the community assisted in making the arrest of Sonakele possible. “Phikolomzi, originally from Mqanduli, was re-arrested by the police through community assistance whilst hiding in a forest at Nxarhuni location,” he said. “He is the second suspect to be re-arrested after Sandile Vena, who was re-arrested on Tuesday. “Two more convicts are still at large. We urge the members of the public not to try and arrest them instead to inform the nearest police station because they are very dangerous.” Vulindlela Station Commander, Lt Colonel Monde Mgolodela, acknowledged Nxarhuni community members for their assistance. "The partnership between the community in Nxarhuni and the police is growing from strength to strength. We need to stand together in a fight against crime," he said.
