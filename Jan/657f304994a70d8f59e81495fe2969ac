 A 72-year-old pensioner died on Friday following a fire that broke out at a frail care centre in Morningside, Port Elizabeth. According to a local private security company, Atlas Security, they received a phone call that informed them that there was fire at the Executive Frail Care. “One person has died after the fire gutted the frail care home. Along with the community, we assisted in relocating the residents to a home nearby,” the company said. Police spokesperson, Col Priscilla Naidu, said that it is alleged that at about 08:00, all the elderly people at the centre, except for one, were having breakfast in their dining.  “A worker at the centre was taking breakfast up to the person when she noticed smoke on the upper level. She ran back downstairs and alerted everyone,” Col Naidu said. She added that the cause of the fire is unknown.  “Police have opened an inquest docket,” Col Naidu said. Meanwhile, Atlas said that the elderly residents are in need of food, juice, toilet paper, nappies and anything else that could assist them during this time. “Drop off point is at 4 Colin Road, Morningside, Port Elizabeth, or contact Charmaine Roos on 071 562 5413.”
