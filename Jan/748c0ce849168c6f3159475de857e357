 The South African Social Security Agency (SASSA) has successfully initiated a test case to directly pay about 100 social grant beneficiaries using commercial bank accounts of their choice as part of the January 2018 payment cycle. “With effect from 01 February 2018, SASSA will continue to make direct deposits into all beneficiary commercial bank accounts. "SASSA has received and confirmed details of the commercial bank accounts of about 2,001,233 (two million one thousand two hundred and thirty three) beneficiaries, who are receiving their social grants through banks,” said SASSA CEO, Ms Pearl Bengu. Bengu explained that the 100 beneficiaries test case is part of implementing SASSA’s plan to insource social grant payments. The plan will be implemented in an incremental and phased manner leading to a Desired Future State where SASSA Owns, Operates and Delivers a 'One Stop' Grant Administration and Payment Service. SASSA will continue to pay all beneficiaries, who receive their grants at cash paypoints or those, who use various merchants throughout the country. "The SASSA Payment Card use has been extended until 31 December 2018 and will be used to access social grants."
