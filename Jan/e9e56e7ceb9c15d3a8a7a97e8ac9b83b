 Charges of escaping from lawful custody will certainly be added to one of four convicted criminals, who made a daring escape at the Mdantsane Correctional Centre last week, after he was re-arrested by members of the King Williams Town Flying Squad and K9 Unit on Tuesday afternoon. According to police information, 22-year-old escapee, Sandile Vena, was arrested at Peelton. At the time of his escape, he had been serving a 23-year jail sentence for rape, housebreaking, robbery and theft. "Officers followed the information they received  that the escapee is at Mdange Location in Peelton," described police spokesperson, Siphokazi Mawisa. "The arrest happened at about 15h00 and the Correctional Services was also on the scene. "When he saw the Police and Correctional Services, he ran to the bushes and was arrested after they gave chase." She said that Sandile Vena is detained at Vulindlela and will appear at Mdantsane Magistrate's Court soon. The prisoners apparently escaped after tampering with the locks at the Mdantsane Correctional Facility. Their escape was only noticed last week Wednesday. Convicts still on the run are 19-year-old Lihle Zikholisile, who was serving a 35-year jail sentence for robbery, housebreaking, rape, and murder; 23-year-old Phikolomzi Sonakele and a 22-year-old Zimbabwean national, Norman Mukunuwendo, who were convicted for robbery with aggravating circumstances. Sonakele was serving a 12-year jail sentence while Mukunuwendo was serving a 15-year sentence.
