 The South African Police Service (SAPS) is warning Nelson Mandela Bay stokvel savings clubs to change their strategies in 2018 to avoid being victims of armed robberies. According to police spokesperson, Captain Andre Beetge, the Motherwell Cluster Commander, Major General Dawie Rabie is deeply concerned in terms of cases that were reported because of armed robberies targeting stokvel money. "Organisers of these savings clubs needs to seriously change their strategy and methods when these large amounts of cash are distributed to its members," he added. Captain Beetge said that this came after more than 20 armed robbery cases were reported in December - a total amount of R1 million was robbed from investments in 2017. "SAPS are inviting the organisers of Stokvel’s, security companies and banking institutions to join hands with police to come up with a working solution to ensure that such robberies can be avoided," Major General Rabie said. "It is a new year and organisers of these savings clubs are gearing to start the new savings cycles. They (organisers) need to put mechanisms and procedures in place to ensure that distribution at the end of 2018 can be safe and secure. "As SAPS, we need to have these organisers come to their closest police stations to enlist to take part in workshops aiming to ensure that they don’t fall victims to robberies by the end of the year at pay-outs and distributions. "Workshops will be conducted with security companies and banking institutions to plan support structures for these savings clubs,” Major General Rabie concluded."
