 A 23-year-old man is expected in court on Friday after he was arrested by Kwazakhele police for allegedly robbing a 30-year-old man at gunpoint on Tuesday morning. According to Captain Andre Beetge, the man was robbed of his cell phone and money after the suspect pounced on him while he was walking in the streets of Kwazakhele, Port Elizabeth, in the morning. "After being robbed, the man went to Zwide police station to ask for help, and when police returned with him towards the scene, the suspect was spotted and shown to the members as he walked further up in Kani Street at 08:50," he described. "On seeing the police vehicle, the suspect pointed a firearm at police. "When police officers fired two warning shots, he attempted to flee, but was arrested and the firearm confiscated." Captain Beetge added that the suspect will appear before the New Brighton Magistrate's Court on Friday on charges of armed robbery, possession of an unlicensed firearm and pointing of a firearm at police.
