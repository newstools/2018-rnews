 A 39-year-old former employee of the Northern Cape Department of Justice and Constitutional Development, appeared at Jankempdorp Magistrate’s Court on Monday on charges of fraud and corruption. Itumeleng Setshaba Mokwena allegedly used an accomplice’s details to submit a fraudulent insurance claim documents at Russels furniture store worth R30 000 in Jankempdorp. "The claim was paid on 30 July 2014 and the money was shared amongst them. "The Hawks’ Serious Corruption Crime unit arrested Mokwena on January 22, after investigations revealed that the beneficiary of a deceased customer was altered and replaced by the recruited claimant," said police spokesperson, Captain Philani Nkwalase. "This was in the wake of an alleged disagreement between the two suspects on sharing of the proceeds of crime. "The case has been postponed to 21 February 2018 for further investigation, meanwhile Mokwena has been released on R3 000 bail." Police said that an additional arrest on this matter is imminent. Court interpreter fined "On as separate and unrelated matter, McAnderson Doctor, working as a Court interpreter at Galeshewe Court for the Department of Justice, pleaded guilty on two charges of corruption and defeating the ends of justice last week," said Captain Nkwalase. "Consequently, he was fined R12 000 with an alternative five years imprisonment. He was further sentenced to an additional three year imprisonment suspended for five years on condition that he does not commit similar offences." He added that McAnderson facilitated bribery transaction between a Home Affairs Immigration Officer and an illegal immigrant arrested for not having the necessary asylum documents. The Immigration Officer reported the incident to the Department of Home Affairs’ management, who later referred the matter to the Hawks for further investigation.
