 CCTV footage capturing the moment a group of youngsters appear to have made off with a National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) Pink Rescue Floatation Buoy has been posted to the NSRI web page www.nsri.org.za and to the NSRI Facebook page. "NSRI appeal to those, who appear to have taken the buoy to return it to NSRI or return it to its pole on the beach at Jeffreys Bay," said NSRI Spokesperson, Craig Lambinon. "The buoy was taken from Point, at Jeffreys Bay, a popular surfing spot." In the footage, are what appear to be three young males taking the buoy to their car. "Bystanders have come forward saying that they had confronted the group in a heated exchange, but despite being advised to return the buoy to the pole they continued to load the buoy into a a small hatchback red car with Eastern Cape registration plates and drove off," described Lambinon. "If anyone recognises the persons in the CCTV footage please contact NSRI." These Pink Buoys are a joint NSRI and public effort in one of many campaigns launched this year to prevent drowning around our coast. "A pink buoy in Wilderness has already contributed to saving the life of a teenager," Lambinon appealed. "Dr Cleeve Robertson, NSRI CEO, has urged anyone finding a pink buoy that is in anyones possession and is not on a pole on a beach it belongs to NSRI and to the public in the interests of public safety."
