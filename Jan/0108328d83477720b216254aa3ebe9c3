 A man from Bloemfontein was declared dead on the scene after he was found floating in the surf over the weekend at Morgan Bay, outside East London. According to Geoff McGregor, National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) East London station commander, at 12h50, on Sunday, the NSRI East London were alerted to reports of a drowning in progress at Morgan Bay. "Morgan Bay Hotel owner Richard Warren Smith launched his jet-ski and recovered a 39-year-old man, who was found floating face down in the surfline about 100 meters off-shore and he brought the victim to the beach where, assisted by bystanders, CPR (Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation) efforts were commenced," he described. "An EC Government Health EMS rescue helicopter arrived and paramedics continued with CPR but sadly after all efforts to resuscitate the man were exhausted he was declared deceased."  McGregor said that police and the Forensic Pathology Services were alerted. "The deceased man is from Bloemfontein," he added. "Richard Warren Smith is commended for his efforts."
