 The wait for results is almost over for the Class of 2017 as Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga is set to announce the outcomes of the National Senior Certificate (NSC) Examination this evening. The Minister will release the national pass rate as well as figures for the provinces in a live broadcast at 6pm from the SABC studios in Auckland Park, Johannesburg. On Wednesday, the Minister and her team briefed President Jacob Zuma on the performance of the 2017 matrics at his home in KwaZulu-Natal. In a tweet, the department said: “The President has now been officially briefed. Minister Motshekga has given President Zuma full details regarding matric results for 2017. We can now say it’s all systems go.” Following the announcement this evening, candidates' individual results will be made available on 5 January 2018 at the school or centre where they wrote their exams. Their partial results will be made available on the department’s website. A total of 634 527 full-time and 168 109 part-time candidates were registered to write the exams. KwaZulu-Natal presented the highest number of full-time candidates with 153 624 learners. Gauteng, with 41 952 candidates, contributed the most part-time candidates in the 2017 NSC examination. In the Eastern Cape, 83 968 full time and 21 789 part-time candidates - totalling 105 757 candidates, registered for the Grade 12 NSC examinations. The department had made provision for 3 805 full-time and 544 part-time special needs candidates with barriers to learning such as dyslexia, blindness and deafness. The Class of 2017 was the fourth Grade 12 cohort to write final examinations under the Curriculum Assessment Policy Statements (CAPS). While the class of 2017 is the 10th group of learners to sit for the NSC, it is only the fourth to write the CAPS aligned NSC examination. Umalusi, the Council for Quality Assurance in General and Further Education and Training, announced last week that the 2017 National Senior Certificate examinations were credible. According to Umalusi, there were 104 001 (16%) progressed learners in the Class of 2017. This is slightly down from the 108 742 of 2016. - SAnews.gov.za
