 George Fire Brigade and Cllr Marlene Barnardt, Ward Councillor for Ward 4 partnered with Wilderness locals and Southern Cape Fire Association to put mechanisms in place to protect themselves and their properties when possible fires break out. The two horrific fires experienced in Wilderness in 2016 and 2017 have prompted residents especially the Wilderness Residents and Ratepayers Association to get involved and be pre-emptive in these situations. The initiative was taken to establish a Fire Management Unit (FMU)for Wilderness as well as for Kleinkrantz.  At the first meeting to establish the FMU for Wilderness, Dirk Smit from the Southern Cape Fire Association (SCFA) addressed a group of about 20 residents who have availed themselves to get involved. Some will act as fire monitors for their street or area and others will help where possible.  A training session will be presented in February and this should kick-start the initiative.
