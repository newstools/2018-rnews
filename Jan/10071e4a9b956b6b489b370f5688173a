 The Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality's Metro Police arrested three young men with a homemade shotgun while Traffic Officials brought a taxi driver with no license, an unroadworthy and apparently hopelessly intoxicated to book. Metro Police Chief, Yolande Faro, said one of her shifts was busy monitoring pick-up points at schools for overloading when they received a complaint at 13:30. “The officers received a complaint that three boys were robbing and threatening school children at Nooitgedacht and William Slammert. “Upon investigation, they arrested three suspects, aged 18, 19 and 24, with a homemade shotgun. “The 19 and 24-year-old suspects were taken to the Gelvandale South African Police Services (SAPS) and the third suspect was taken to Stepping Stones Rehabilitation Centre,” Faro said. In another incident Traffic officers Joseph Ngcanga and Lubabalo Manentsa noticed a packed taxi driving erratically in Uitenhage Road in the vicinity of Mati Road shortly after 15:00. They were patrolling as part of the Traffic Department’s Scholar Transport Safety initiative. Mr Warren Prins, Director: Traffic and Licensing, said when the vehicle was pulled over, it was overloaded with 39 children. “All of the tyres were smooth and the driver had no drivers license or permits. When he was asked to blow into the breathalyzer a reading of 1.24 was measured which far exceeds the legal limit. “The vehicle was impounded and the driver taken to the Algoa Park South African Police Services,” Prins said. The taxi association was contacted to arrange alternative transport for the learners.
