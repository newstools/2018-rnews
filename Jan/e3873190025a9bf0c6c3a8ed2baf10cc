 The South African Revenue Service (SARS) reminds individual taxpayers who filed personal income tax returns last year and were assessed to owe SARS money that they have until 31 January 2018 to make payment. According to acting SARS spokesperson, Sicelo Mkosi, there are about 236 500 individual taxpayers countrywide, who fall into this category. “These taxpayers filed their personal income tax returns during Tax Season 2017. These income tax returns were assessed and the taxpayers were found to owe SARS money,” Mkosi said. He added that these taxpayers will face various enforcement actions, such as penalties, interests as well as criminal processes if they do not pay by this deadline. “SARS thanks taxpayers who filed income tax returns during tax season and who already paid their tax debt. However, SARS would like to impress upon the affected taxpayers who have not yet paid, to do so by 31 January or make a payment arrangement with SARS.” SARS does make allowance for taxpayers in financial difficulty to approach it in order to defer payment or pay in instalments within qualifying criteria. “Taxpayers who wish to make such a payment arrangement must go to their nearest SARS branch or call the SARS Contact Centre on 0800 00 7277,” Mkosi added. Taxpayers are reminded that three main payment channels are available, namely on eFiling, at a bank or via EFT. SARS branches do not accept payments, whether cash or cheque.
