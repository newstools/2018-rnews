 Due to the ongoing drought, the Kouga Local Municipality on Tuesday announced that watershedding will be introduced to the towns of Hankey and Patensie. "The towns of Hankey and Patensie have just about used up their water quotas for the period ending June 2018," the municipality said. "As a result, water shedding will soon have to be introduced." It said that more info will be communicated in due course. "In the meantime, all residents and businesses are urged to use water extremely sparingly and only when absolutely necessary," the Kouga Municipality said. "We need to make the little bit of water that is left, go as far as is possible." At the end of 2016, the Kouga and Nelson Mandela Bay municipalities introduced water restrictions after poor rains that have seen the dams supplying the regions in a precarious position.
