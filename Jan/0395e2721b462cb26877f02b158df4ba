 The SAPS have warned the public to be vigilant when moving around with large amounts of money for business purposes and school payments when businesses and schools will re-open soon to avoid being victims of armed robberies. According to police spokesperson, Captain Andre Beetge, in the past years, this time has also seen an increase in armed robberies. “The SAPS focus on these crimes and the firearms involved paid off when six persons were arrested during the early morning hours on Friday for the illegal possession of unlicensed firearms,” Captain Beetge described. Captain Beetge stated that the SAPS followed up information they received, which led to the arrest of a 22-year-old in possession of an illegal firearm in Ikamvelihle. “The suspect was arrested at Love and Peace Shop in NU1, Motherwell. Police also seized two toy guns, which were found with the firearm.” He added that Motherwell police again followed up information, which led to two separate addresses. “At the first one, along Ngxaza Street, NU9, suspected stolen property was found as well as an unlicensed firearm. “Two males, aged 26 and 33 years old, as well as two females, aged 21 and 15 years old, were arrested at 07:20 on Friday,” described Captain Beetge. “The suspected stolen property included a flat Screen TV and three cellphones.” He said that at the second house at Ntsanyana Street, NU9, one male suspect, aged 23 years old, was arrested at 07:40 on Friday for being in possession of an unlicensed firearm. “The five adult suspects will appear before the Motherwell Magistrates Court on Monday on their respective charges for illegal possession of unlicensed firearms and possession of suspected stolen goods, while the 15-year-old female suspect was placed in the care of the Nerina House Juvenile facility.”
