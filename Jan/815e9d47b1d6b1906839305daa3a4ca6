 The Democratic Alliance (DA) in the Western Cape has made a formal submission to the City of Cape Town’s City Manager, Achmat Ebrahim, stating its objection to the proposed water levy (water tax) in the strongest possible terms. "I wrote a letter to the City of Cape Town City Manager, Achmat Ebrahim, on 13 December 2017 stating we are against the proposed water levy, as it places a burden on residents to pay more in order to make up for the City’s loss of income," said Anton Bredell - DA Western Cape Provincial Chairperson. Bredell  said that the DA Western Cape does not support placing the residents under financial strain in an attempt to generate a greater income for drought disaster relief at the expense of our people. "It would be unfair to add a water levy with most residents already bearing the brunt of the country’s economic state, we simply cannot expect them to pay more. "We have therefore made a formal submission against the water levy in the hopes that the City of Cape Town would reconsider placing the residents under financial strain," he said. "The responsibility ultimately falls on the City’s leadership, political and administrative, to ensure the best possible outcome during this challenging period. The residents should not be made to pay." Bredell  said that the DA will continue to act in the best interests of the residents and hopes the City Manager will follow suit by reconsidering the unfair proposed water levy. "Our people deserve to be treated fairly. "We will continue making progress by ensuring the Party’s manifesto is delivered to ensure that we deliver quality services, create job opportunities and apply a zero-tolerance approach to corruption," he added.
