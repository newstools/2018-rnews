She said that, for the past seven years, they have noted that the NSC pass rate has consistently been above the 70% threshold. "The Class of 2017 must be commended for maintaining this trend.

"However, with the progressed learners included, the overall pass rate, stands at 75.1%, a 2.6% improvement from the 72.5% achieved in 2016. This, represents a total of 401 435 candidates, who had passed the 2017 NSC examinations. Well done to the Class of 2017."
