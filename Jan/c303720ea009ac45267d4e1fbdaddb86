 Police in Knysna have opened an inquest docket after a 24-year-old man drowned while visiting the Knysna Lagoon with his family. According to Jerome Simonis, National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) Knysna station commander, at 14h56, on Wednesday, the NSRI Knysna duty crew were activated following reports from the SA Police Services (SAPS) of a drowning in progress at The Point, Knysna Lagoon. "NSRI Knysna rescue swimmers responded directly to the scene and the SA Police Services, WC Government Health EMS, a Police Dive Unit, Community Police Forum and Knysna Fire and Rescue Services responded. "It appears that a man, in the company of family, had jumped into the water and reportedly unable to swim it is suspected that the man may have believed the water depth to be shallow," he described. "On arrival on the scene, NSRI rescue swimmers deployed into the lagoon to free dive search for the 24-year-old local man that his family on the scene reported him to be missing under water."  During a free dive search, NSRI rescue swimmers located the body of the man and a police diver was deployed into the water to assist NSRI in the recovery of the body. "Sadly paramedics have declared the man deceased," Simonis said, adding, "Police have opened an inquest docket. The body of the man has been taken into the care of the Forensic Pathology Services." He said that the family are being assisted by trauma counsellors.
