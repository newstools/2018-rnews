 A 58-year-old Port Elizabeth woman is expected in court on Monday after she was arrested by police on drug related charges over the weekend. “Being alert and inquisitive to anything and everything is important in the vocation of a police officer,” described police spokesperson, Colonel Priscilla Naidu. She said that being inquisitive led police officers to arresting the woman on Sunday. According to Col Naidu, two police officers from SAPS Kabega Park were patrolling in Kragga Kamma Road when they saw a wall that had collapsed due to the strong winds experienced on Sunday. “While inspecting the wall, they noticed a plantation of trees that looked like dagga plants. “The curious officers went into the property and found hundreds of dagga trees growing around a small house and a dilapidated caravan,” she described. “On further inspection of the caravan and house, 300 litres of pure alcohol, measuring syringes, dry dagga, dagga oil and containers were found inside. About 300 trees were uprooted.” Col Naidu said that while the officers were still busy with the investigation, a 58-year-old woman arrived and claimed to be living at the property. “She was arrested for dealing, possession and cultivation of dagga. She will appear in court on Monday.”
