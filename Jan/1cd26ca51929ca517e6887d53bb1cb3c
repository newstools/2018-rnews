 The past weekend did not yield much promising rain for Port Elizabeth, the South African Weather Service said on Monday. "However, some welcome falls were recorded in the main catchment of the metro," describedÂ Garth Sampson, Client Liaison Officer for the Eastern Cape at the South African Weather Service. "Although different parts of Port Elizabeth had between 1 and 5 mm, Uitenhage recorded just short of 25 mm. "The official figures from the catchment of the main storage dams of the metro were between 15 and 25 mm." Sampson said that the unofficial figures from the Musgund area were between 50 and 70 mm. "This is great news as these follow up rains come less than a week after the heavy rains over the Baviaans last Sunday," he added. "Further afield, George recorded 13 mm; East London - 9 mm; Mthatha and Bisho both had 12 mm. "The most outstanding figure occurred in Grahamstown, which measured 37 mm over the weekend."
