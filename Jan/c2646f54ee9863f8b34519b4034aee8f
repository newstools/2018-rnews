 A 32-year-old man from Mdantsane, East London, is expected to appear in court on Monday after his arrest on Friday by police in connection with the murder of a Blue Bulls rugby player, Mlungisi Bali. According to police spokesperson, Captain Mluleki Mbi, “It is alleged the suspect had an argument with the deceased and stabbed him once in the chest.” The incident happened last month and Bali was rushed to a local hospital where later died on Wednesday. The suspect will appear before the Mdantsane Magistrate's Court on Monday, facing a charge of murder. In a tribute, the Blue Bulls said that had been deeply saddened to hear about the passing of their former lock. “The 27-year-old St Albans ‘old boy’, represented the Blue Bulls between 2007 and 2010, also spending valuable career time with the Griffons and the Border Bulldogs,” the club said. “Bali featured strongly for the under 19 and under 21 teams at Loftus, and in 2010 was selected to represent the South African U20 team that played in the IRB Junior World Championship in Argentina, playing alongside the likes of Elton Jantjies, Patrick Lambie and his dear friend CJ Stander, who also captained the team. “Our sincerest condolences and prayers go out to his family and loved ones, and the rugby community in general. “We have lost not only a superb athlete, but also an exceptional human being and a role model to many young South Africans.”
