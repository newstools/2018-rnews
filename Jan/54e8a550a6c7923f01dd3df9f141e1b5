"While still shocked, she heard the baby crying from the pit toilet and called her sister and the neighbours. "The police and Emergency Medical and Rescue Services (EMRS) were summoned to the scene where the new born baby was rescued. The mother and the baby were taken to hospital for medical examination," added  Lieutenant Colonel Funani .
