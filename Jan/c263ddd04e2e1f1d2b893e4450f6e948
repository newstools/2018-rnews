 The Congress of the People (COPE) said that it welcomes the changes announced to the board at troubled parastatal, Eskom. COPE spokesperson, Glacier Nkhwashu, said that the party has been advocating for the change at Eskom for a very long time. “Eskom stood at the epicentre of the corruption and State Capture project. “The corruption and maladministration that was allowed to be committed at Eskom under the watch of the ANC imperilled our very sovereignty and existence as a nation," Nkhwashu added. "What was allowed to happen has had disastrous consequences for our economy and our fight against the challenges of poverty, inequality and unemployment. “The Congress of the People welcomes the changes announced in the board of Eskom." Nkhwashu said that they trust that this change signals the beginning of the responsible and progressive governance of the nation's most strategic of SOEs. “But there must still be accountability and consequences for all of those, who were complicit in and facilitated the theft and grand looting - the sabotaging of Eskom and SAinc,” Nkhwashu said.
