 Police efforts to destroy the lucrative drug trade in the Western Cape resulted in the apprehension of two suspects during two separate raids, netting drugs with a combined value of more than R1.6 million on Monday night. "Members attached to Operation Combat embarked on an intelligence driven operation and searched a residence in Flora Road, Steenberg, where a 31-year-old suspect was arrested for being in possession of 9 451 mandrax tablets with an estimated street value of R567 000," described police spokesperson, Lieutenant Colonel Andrè Traut. He said that from there, the operation moved to Kirstenhof where a residence in Palm Tree Village was searched. "This led to the arrest of a 33-year-old suspect, who was found in possession of 4kg of tik and 32 000 mandrax tablets with a total estimated street value of R1 072 000, as well as R163 190 cash, believed to be the proceeds of drug trafficking," Lieutenant Colonel Traut said. "Once charged, the suspects are due to make court appearances on charges of drug dealing." The Provincial Commissioner of the Western Cape police, Lt Gen KE Jula, praised his members for the sterling work and said that the arrests were sure to have an adverse effect on the drug trade in the province.
