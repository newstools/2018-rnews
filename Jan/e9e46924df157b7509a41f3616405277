 A 22-year-old man is expected in court on Wednesday after he was arrested at his home in Sali Street, Kwazakele, Port Elizabeth, by police for dealing in dagga. According to police spokesperson, Captain Andre Beetge, the man was arrested by members of the Motherwell Cluster Operational Command Centre on Monday night after residents complained about drugs being sold to children in the area. “SAPS followed the information that led them to the suspect. He was caught in possession of 24 zolls dagga, 17 bompies dagga and 200 grams of loose dagga, as well as a large amount of money, suspected to proceeds from the crime,” he explained. “He was also found in possession of a counterfeit R100 note. “The suspect will appear before the New Brighton Magistrates Court on Wednesday on charges of dealing in dagga as well as being in possession of counterfeit money.” The Motherwell Cluster Commander, Major General Dawie Rabie, has applauded the arrest and added: "We need our community to come forward with information of these drug dealers in order for us to create a safe and drug-free environment for our community and youth".
