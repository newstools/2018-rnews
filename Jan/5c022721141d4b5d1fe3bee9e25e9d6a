 Police have cautioned parents after a 7-year-old boy drowned over the weekend while apparently swimming in a deep river with his friends. According to police spokesperson, Captain Siphokazi Mawisa, police were called to a drowning at Tshabo Location, in Ndevana, on Sunday night. "It is alleged that a 7-year-old boy was swimming with his friends (five boys aged between 7 and 9 years old) when he drowned in Buffalo River. "The Search and Rescue team were called and promised to do the search on Monday morning as it was already dark on Sunday night," she said. "On Monday morning, they came and conducted a search and could not find the body as the dam is deep." Captain Mawisa said that the Search and Rescue Teams from East London and King Williams Town again conducted the search and later found the body. "SAPS is appealing to parents to always keep a wide eye open on their children and tell them not to swim in the dams in their areas," she added. "If they swim in beaches or swimming pools they must be under parents guidance to avoid these drowning."
