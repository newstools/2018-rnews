 Two Jeffreys Bay children, aged 10 and 11, who were reported missing on Wednesday afternoon were found safe by members of a local private security company. According ot Rieghard Janse van Rensburg, National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) Jeffreys Bay station commander, at 16h46 on Wednesday, the NSRI Jeffreys Bay duty crew were activated following reports from SMHART Security of two children, aged 10 and 11, from Aston Bay, missing after reportedly going for a walk to a local Park. They apparently had last been seen at 11h00 on Wednesday and had failed to return home. "Members of SMHART Security had initiated a search and NSRI Jeffreys Bay crew dispatched our sea rescue vehicle and additional NSRI crew in their private vehicles and the SA Police Services responded to join in a search," described Janse van Rensburg. "Their most likely movements were determined in discussions with the childrens Grand Mother, who had been looking after them, and with their mother who had returned from work. "During an extensive search the children were located safe by SMHART Security officers, they were found between Aston Bay and Paradise Beach, and returned home where they were reunited with their family." He said that the children were unaware that they had been reported missing. "NSRI commend SMHART Security for escalating the search and to all involved in ensuring the children were found safe."
