 The Democratic Alliance (DA) in the Eastern Cape on Thursday said that it condemns the incident of violence in the Buffalo City Metro (BCM) in which two of its public representatives are alleged to have been involved. "This refers to a recent incident in which the representatives allegedly got involved in a scuffle with two members of the public," said Andrew Whitfield - DA Eastern Cape Provincial Chairperson. It is alleged that DA Member of the Provincial Legislature, Sanele Magaqa, on the 29th of December hosted a family ceremony where he had invited fellow party members. However, he allegedly ended up attacking a female DA member, Nomkhitha Manzini, after she got into an argument with her boyfriend, DA activist, Thembela Dyongwana. Apparently, Magaqa and Dyongwana are friends. A DA Councillor in the Buffalo City Metro, Simphiwe Tsala, allegedly intervened and is accused of severely assaulting Dyongwana in the process. "The complaint has already been investigated by the Provincial Disciplinary Committee (PDC) and the Provincial Executive Committee (PEC) has considered the findings and suspended the public representatives in question," said Whitfield. Whitfield said that the PEC has also formally referred the matter to the Federal Legal Commission (FLC) for their urgent attention. Image: Andrew Whitfield - DA Eastern Cape Provincial Chairperson.
