 The uncertainty around President Jacob Zuma continues after the Presidency refuted media reports on Wednesday morning that Zuma would address a media briefing following his recall by the African National Congress (ANC). In a statement, the Presidency said there had been no official communication on the matter. “The media is advised that no official communication has been issued by the Presidency on a media briefing today by President Jacob Zuma as reported by media house,” it said in a brief statement. “The media is urged to await official notification.” The news came as a surprise for reporters from many media houses, who had apparently gathered outside the Union Buildings, in Pretoria, for the President’s statement only to be informed that no media briefing had been announced in the first place. There is speculation that President Jacob Zuma will have a media briefing later today, but the reports have again not yet been confirmed.
