 Efforts by police to address gang violence in the Northern Areas of Port Elizabeth led to the swift arrest of an alleged gang affiliate for involvement in a shooting in Shauderville. The suspect was out on bail for another case of attempted murder. "It is alleged that on Saturday, at about 07:00, the 19-year-old victim and friends were drinking in Ferreira Street in Shauderville when  a Nissan bakkie stopped near them. "One person got out of the vehicle and walked towards the group. As the suspect got nearer, he pulled out a firearm and fired a shot at the victim," described police spokesperson, Col Priscilla Naidu. "The victim was struck by the bullet in his left lower leg. "A description and name of suspect was given to police and Gelvandale members patrolled the area in search of the suspect." She said that a short while later, the suspect was spotted in Roos Street in a white BMW. "The vehicle was stopped and searched. The occupants of the vehicle was also searched. "One of the occupants fitted the description and name of the suspect," Col Naidu said. "He was arrested and detained on attempted murder. The suspect is currently out on bail for another attempted murder case." He will appear in court on Monday for the recent attempted murder. "The SAPS is committed in their quest in apprehending criminals  especially gang members  who are endangering the lives and instilling fear in many law abiding citizens in the Northern Areas," Col Naidu added.
