 One of the most successful Teambuilding and Corporate Entertainment companies in South Africa, African Drumbeat, which is based in Port Elizabeth, had the pleasure ofperforming at a glam event over the weekend, when a local company, Continental General Tire, hosted its sales and marketing conference and dinner. The gala had delegates from sales and marketing divisions from the company's South African branches. The theme was 'beach', so the event was hosted on the beach under the Happy Valley bridge in Summerstrand, Port Elizabeth, where African Drumbeat drummers and fire jugglers entertained the guests.
