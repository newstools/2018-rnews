 The Coega Development Corporation on Thursday held its Suppliers day event at the Coega Vulindlela Accommodation and Conference Centre, in Port Elizabeth, where Zibu Ndikinda, managing director of Phila Environmental, Health and Safety Specialists, was a keynote speaker. She left local Small, Medium and Micro-sized Enterprises (SMMEs) owners with food for thought. Ndikinda was a Regional Business Achievers Award in the Emerging Entrepreneur category in 2010 through the Port Elizabeth branch of the Businesswomen’s Association of South Africa. In her speech, Ndikinda said: “I created opportunities and I created networks with a number of various stakeholders. “With me having to do audits and inspections I realised that there is a gap in terms of doing certification and I partnered up with DQS who does certification for me. That meant that I didn’t have to employ someone within my company.” She also revealed that she is involved in various projects such as Grey water system project and the creation of a new wheelchair ramp after being inspired by her wheelchair co-worker’s story. Apparently, the Grey water system object she created traps used water for re-flushing. “When you wash your hands, it traps the water from the sink and when you bath as well, the water gets trapped. It is then used when you flush your toilet rather than using clean fresh water that is already scarce in South Africa,” Ndikinda described. “When you bath, all that water from your bath goes outside and recycles the water. There are some tests that this has undergone and it has been proven to be working very well and is cost-effective. “In other cities, this type of water saving strategy has been used, such as Klekerdorp.” She said that she met with Nomvula Paula Mokonyane, the Minister of Department of Water and Sanitation of South Africa, who has since endorsed the system. Ndikinda further advised the SMMEs to always remain humble, control their thoughts by not letting other people define them.
