 Seven robbery suspects were arrested on Sunday as they allegedly attempted to rob an egg farm outside Thornhill on Sunday. "On Sunday, at around 08:00, it is alleged that seven men, three with firearms stormed into an eggs farm outside Thornhill. "One of the employees pressed the panic alarm, and suspects stole an employee's cellphone before sped off in a gold VW Polo," said police spokesperson, Sergeant Majola Nkohli. "Police on receiving a complaint dispatched a patrol vehicle and a gold VW Polo was spotted on N2 near Van Stadens bridge and high speed chase ensued." He said that police from nearby stations gave back, and a vehicle was cornered at Agnes Street, Port Elizabeth, and four occupants were arrested. "Police found a stolen cellphone and also seized false registration number plates. "A preliminary investigation led to the arrest of three other suspects walking along the N2," Sergeant Nkohli described. "Police have confiscated the vehicle." Humansdorp Cluster Commander, Brigadier John Lebok said: "This success is a testimony that police are indeed reclaiming the streets from criminals". The suspects, aged between 28 and 35 years old, will appear in court soon on charges ranging from attempted business robbery to possession of stolen property.
