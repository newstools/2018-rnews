 There was a general decline in crime in the Eastern Cape during the 2017/18 festive season compared to the previous season, according to the Eastern Cape MEC for Safety and Liaison, Wiziwe Tikana. "However, the number of murders is still of great concern," said Bobby Stevenson, the Democratic Alliance's Eastern Cape Shadow MEC for Safety and Security. "During the period, 449 violent deaths occurred of which 298 were over the Christmas weekend and 151 during the New Year’s weekend as per information provided by the Department of Health. "The high crime rate in the Eastern Cape continues to strike fear into the hearts of residents and remains a deterrent to investors and tourists." He said that, according to a reply to a legislature question he asked MEC Tikana, there were 2 897 fewer cases reported during the 2017/18 festive season. "However, carjackings increased with 8.57%, which included 13 more cases in the Buffalo City Municipality (East London: 6; Mdantsane: 4; King William’s Town: 2)  than the previous year. "We welcome the decrease of 42.11%  in carjackings in the Nelson Mandela Bay Metro (NMBM). This trend shows the success achieved in the Metro through cooperation between the Municipal Traffic Department, Metro Police and the South African Police Service," Stevenson said.
