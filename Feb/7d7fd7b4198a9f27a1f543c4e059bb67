 A total of R6 million will be spent over three years on upgrading and improving facilities at the Motherwell Fire Station in Port Elizabeth. "When this coalition government came into office, this fire station was immediately identified for upgrade. So far, capital spend has been on target, and excellent progress is being made," described Nerlson Mandela Bay Municipality Executive Mayor, Athol Trollip. "This 3-year refurbishment is set to improve delivery of fire and emergency services to the surrounding communities of Well’s Estate, Motherwell and Blue Water Bay. "The station’s area of coverage also includes Coega and the Port of Ngqura." He said that some of the upgrades include a new perimeter fence with electric gates, a new building layout to accommodate four new electronic vehicle bay doors and a new standby generator to supply the whole Station with electricity in the event of a power failure. "Furthermore the entire station will be fitted with new lighting, flooring and staff facilities," Trollip said. "All residents must benefit from high quality emergency services, no matter where one lives. "This coalition government continues to improve service delivery, so that we can build a safe and well run City."
