 The South African Weather Service's Port Elizabeth office would like to inform local residents that a weather system that could result in heavy rainfall is anticipated this weekend. "Majority of the rainfall will be confined to the eastern parts of the Chris Hani District and towards the east coast (from Port Alfred extending eastwards)," said Garth Sampson, Client Liaison Officer for the Eastern Cape at the South African Weather Service. "Most of the rainfall will be on Sunday but thunderstorms with heavy downpours can be expected on Saturday afternoon already." Sampson said that potential impacts from the rain could include flooded roads and streams, localised flooding of low lying areas and road closures with low lying bridges. "We will issue alerts on Thursday as the new models update as it is still a bit far ahead."
