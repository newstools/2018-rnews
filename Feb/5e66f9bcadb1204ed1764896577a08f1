 After days of speculation and drama around the future of Jacob Zuma as the President of South Africa, his party's highest decision-making body, the African National Congress (ANC) National Executive Committee (NEC), is now expected to meet on Monday afternoon to try and resolve the current impasse regarding Zuma's exit. "We do have a meeting tomorrow [Monday], we are unable to speak to the agenda at this stage," ANC spokesman, Pule Mabe, was quoted by Reuters. Monday's special NEC meeting follows another meeting on Saturday, where the ANC top six officials met without Zuma and apparently discussed his exit and the transition process. The ANC has not issued a statement on the outcomes of that meeting. Meanwhile, a group of ANC supporters calling themselves the Zuma Must Go campaign, held a media briefing on Sunday where they announced plans for a march on Monday to the Union Buildings, which they said will bring Pretoria, the capital, if not Gauteng, to a complete standstill in their demand that Zuma immediately resigns. The ANC has, however, distanced itself from the group and said any of its members caught participating in the march would be disciplined. ANC tripartite alliance partner, the South African Communist Party (SACP), which has since had a fall-out with Zuma, also distanced itself from the planned march and said that it would investigate the identity of the man, who alleged that he was representing the party at the media briefing. The drama surrounding the future of President Zuma, has seen the 2018 State of the Nationa Address (SONA), which was scheduled for last week Thursday, being postponed at the last minute. Even if Zuma were to survive a recall by the ANC, he would face a motion of no confidence in Parliament before the end of this month - the nineth such motion during his Presidency.
