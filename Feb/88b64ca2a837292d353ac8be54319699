 Two Peddie men, 26-year-old Mzingisi Matwa, and 33-year-old Simphiwe Gabhela Dyongwana, will be spending a long time behind bars after they were convicted for murder and robbery and sentenced to two life sentences by the Bhisho High Court on Monday. They were also slapped with a three-year sentence for the possession of unlicenced firearm and a year for possession of ammunition. "This sentence follows after an incident that happened on the 9th April 2016, in Dhabani Location, Peddie, where both accused robbed a 54-year-old man of his vehicle at gunpoint," said police spokesperson, Captain Mali Govender. "They shot him and wickedly drove over him with the intention of making certain he was dead." She said that police officers, who were on patrol noticed the vehicle and gave chase and managed to arrest one of the accused, Mzingisi Matwa, whilst the second suspect, Simphiwe Gabhela Dyongwana, fled the scene. "The second suspect was sought for robbery and he was arrested in Port Alfred shortly after the incident." Eastern Cape SAPS Provincial Commissioner, Lt General Liziwe Ntshinga, was elated at the news and said, “It’s the meticulous work of the detectives who put in every effort and long hours in ensuring this resounding success. Last year, we invested more resources in support of detective work and we want to believe that we are reaping the first dividends.”
