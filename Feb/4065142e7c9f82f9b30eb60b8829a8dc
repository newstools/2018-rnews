 “The Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality is already taking strides towards achieving a clean audit, with the search for a new Chief Financial Officer now underway,” Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality Portfolio Councillor for Budget & Treasury, Retief Odendaal, said in a statement on Sunday when he announced a senior management employment vacancy. The Chief Financial Officer is the second last section 56 vacancy left to be filed by the Democratic Alliance (DA) led coalition government. “A stable officialdom is only possible when solid, council-appointed management is in place. “For too long, the City was faced with financial woes as a result of poor controls and a lack of stability in the Budget and Treasury Directorate. “It was during this time, under the former ANC government, that billions of Rands worth of irregular expenditure was incurred,” Cllr Odendaal said. He highlighted the importance of filling in the position as it ensures stability and that ‘Municipality’s finances never collapse again.’ “All matters relating to the resignation of the former CFO were handled by the City Manager. “We are moving closer towards ensuring a well-run and caring City for all. “Stable finances and solid leadership come hand in hand with improved service delivery and accelerated job creation,” concluded.
