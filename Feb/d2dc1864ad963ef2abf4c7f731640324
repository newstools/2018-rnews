 The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) say they reject the cabinet reshuffle announced by President, Cyril Ramaphosa, on Monday night. HERE is Ramaphosa's new Cabinet. EFF National spokesperson, Mbuyiseni Ndlozi, said that as the EFF, they view the reshuffle as a "mere realignment of corrupt and state capture delinquent ministers". “No one, with the best interests of South Africa today, could have Malusi Gigaba, Nomvula Mokonyane, Bathabile Dlamini as cabinet members and ministers,” Ndlozi said. He also said that Gigaba lied under oath while Dlamini nearly collapsed the social grants system for the poor. “Bathabile Dlamini has essentially been rewarded with a promotion into the presidency regardless of the fact that she nearly collapsed the social grants system for the poor. “Above all is Gigaba, whose state capture crimes come close to treason as he facilitated the handing over of state institutions to foreign nationals in the form of the Guptas,” Ndlozi described. He added that keeping such characters in the cabinet is a direct rejection of constitutional order. “Ramaphosa has bowed to factional pressure in the African National Congress (ANC) proving that he is presiding over a kleptocratic collective that cannot be saved. “His inability to dispense with individuals implicated in corruption is evidence that no one can save ANC from corruption. It is entangled for good," Ndlozi said. “We call on the people of South Africa to reject the entire ANC and vote it all out in 2019. We warned that Ramaphosa is only interested in careerism, and has no demonstrable history of integrity and fighting corruption. “Nevertheless, we welcome changes in finance; the appointment of Nhlanhla Nene is a reaffirmation of confidence in black and African leadership." The  Democratic Alliance (DA) also downplayed the new Cabinet while the ANC welcomed it.
