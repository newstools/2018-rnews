 Residents gathered outside the Engcobo Magistrate's Court, in Engcobo, on Monday morning mobilising to oppose the bail when the suspects arrested for involvement in the killing of five police officers and a retired soldier last week make their court appearance. The suspects are expected to appear in court following a shootout with police at a local church, which left seven other suspected robbers dead. “They are facing charges of murder, attempted murder and possession of illegal weapons and ammunition,” said police spokesperson, Captain Khaya Tonjeni. “The memorial service is to be held on Tuesday at the Engcobo Methodist Church. “Various leaders and high level government delegation is expected to attend.” He said that the Engcobo police station has since been re-opened to the public and continues to offer its services to local residents.
