 The fishing boat Alley Cat, which ran aground on Port Elizabeth's Hobie Beach on Sunday, was successfully re-floated during an approaching high tide and towed to the Port of Port Elizabeth by Chokka fishing boats. According to the National Sea Rescue Insititute (NSRI), the skipper and salvage divers remained on the casualty boat, which was successfully pulled off the shoreline by two Chokka fishing boats. "NSRI Port Elizabeth dispatched the sea rescue craft Spirit of Toft, Spirit of Surfski IV and the sea rescue vehicle to stand by on the scene during the salvage effort," described Ian Gray, NSRI Port Elizabeth station commander.
