 A team of SAPS Detectives from Nemato and the Port Alfred K9 unit on Wednesday embarked on an operation to track down wanted suspects and managed to bring 14 of them into custody. According to police spokesperson, Captain Mali Govender, three females, between the ages of 33 and 60, were arrested and detained on charges of serious assault charges during the operation. “A 59-year-old male faces a charge of breach of a protection order,” she added. “Eight males, between the ages of 22 and 47 years, face charges of serious assault while two males, aged 26 and 33, were detained on charges of theft.” Captain Govender said that a 23-year-old was arrested on a warrant of arrest for malicious damage to property that took place in October 2017. “All suspects will appear in the Port Alfred Magistrates court later this week.” Meanwhile, a 27-year-old male will appear in the Grahamstown Magistrate’s Court later this week following his arrest by members of the Grahamstown Highway Patrol on the N2 late on Tuesday night. “The suspect was travelling in a taxi when the members conducted a search operation and seized dagga weighing over 2.5 kgs to the value of approximately R7 800,” Captain Govender said. “In Peddie on Wednesday, members were on patrol when they arrested two males in separate unrelated cases of possession of drugs. Dagga to the value of nearly R200 was seized.” The suspects will appear in the Grahamstown and Peddie Magistrate’s Courts respectively. Both cluster commanders, Brigadier Morgan Govender for Port Alfred and Brigadier David Kanuka for Grahamstown, praised their members for their commitment and dedication.
