 The perfect story – boy meets girl, you fall in love and move in together… In some cases your ‘partnership’ develops into a ‘wedlock’ (wed-LOCK *wink wink nudge nudge*). BUT have you ever considered the possibility of an unfortunate breakup and unhappy ending? What financial implications are you left to deal with when years of union suddenly dissolves? Matthys Potgieter, spokesperson and debt expert at DebtSafe, says whatever the arrangements you have with your partner, when the relationship ends, your financial agreements go along with it. You shared financial burdens like the rent or a bond repayment, you took out a loan to furnish your love-filled nest and you shared other bills like the electricity, water and groceries. So now you are left with more financial obligations than you are used to and, your budget is left in a complete mess where you have more month at the end of your money. What are you to do now with this so called SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DEBT (STD)? Potgieter says it is not as easy as 1, 2, 3 to get rid of your financial STD, but there are a few options to consider: Don’t get stuck in the past, you are better off without your former partner. There is a reason why you should call him / her your ‘ex’.  Give yourself some time to reflect, and accept that life goes on. It is time that you start embracing your new life with a few lessons learnt. Experience is the key to get your finances back on track again.
