 African National Congress (ANC) in the Eastern Cape Provincial Chairperson, Oscar Lubabalo Mabuyane, and ANC Eastern Cape Provincial Deputy Chairperson, Mlungisi Mvoko, are expected to sworn in as Eastern Cape Members of the Provincial Legislature (MPL's) at the Eastern Cape Provincial Legislature in Bhisho on Monday. The swearing in comes amid speculation that Mabuyane will soon succeed current Eastern Cape Premier, Phumulo Masualle, whom he beat for the ANC Chairmanship at the party's 8th Eastern Cape Provincial Elective Conference at the end of September 2017. Mabuyane was understood to be backing Cyril Ramaphosa to succeed Jacob Zuma, which he did after protracted negotiations with Zuma failed and Zuma was forced to resign. Masualle on the other hand was understood to be backing Zuma's ex-wife, Dr Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, who lost to Ramaphosa at the ANC National Elective Conference in December. In January, the new ANC Eastern Cape Provincial Executive Committee (PEC) hinted on a reshuffle at Bhisho. The ANC has long adopted a policy that there cannot be two centres of power - that is having one leader for the party and a different leader to lead its deployees in government. It remains to be seen if Masualle will be the one to deliver the Eastern Cape State of the Province Address (SOPA) that is slated for Friday.
