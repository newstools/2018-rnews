 The Democratic Alliance (DA) in the Eastern Cape on Wednesday said that it condemns Eastern Cape MEC for Education, Mandla Makupula’s non-action in the case of the shortage of Afrikaans teachers in the province. "I have submitted questions to the MEC regarding this matter," said Edmund van Vuuren (MPL), the DA's Eastern Cape Shadow MEC for Education. "Earlier this month, it was reported that learners, their parents and the community at large threatened to close Sandisulwazi Secondary School in Paterson and pupils at schools in the Northern Areas of Port Elizabeth are struggling and failing due to a lack of Afrikaans teachers. "I have warned and challenged the MEC about his plans regarding the critical shortage of Afrikaans teachers in schools on numerous occasions and he has ignored these warnings time and time again. There seems to be a deliberate attempt to exclude Afrikaans as a language option for learners at various schools in the province." Van Vuuren said that Section 29 of our constitution has made provisions for mother-tongue instruction in schools. "We cannot allow learners to fail due to teacher shortages and language barriers in the classroom. The deployment of Afrikaans teachers at schools must be prioritized as a matter of urgency and an increase in Afrikaans training facilities is urgently needed," he added.
