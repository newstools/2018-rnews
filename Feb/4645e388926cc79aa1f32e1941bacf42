 A 33-year-old male is expected in court on Monday after he was arrested on FridayÂ in connection with the latest 'Facebook rape', which happened on Valentines Day. According to police, this was the 10th incident recorded in the Motherwell Cluster area. "The rape took place just after 09:00 on Wednesday, when a 30-year-old woman agreed to meet her facebook friend in NU29, Motherwell," said police spokesperson, Captain Andre Beetge. "It is alleged that the suspect told the victim that his uncle would fetch her. But in reality, it was the suspect himself." After needing to walk through the bushes in NU29, the victim was threatened with a screwdriver and she was raped. "The arrest today is seen as a breakthrough, but our community needs to be more careful about befriending and meeting up with strangers through the social media," added the Motherwell Cluster Commander, Major General Dawie Rabie. The investigating officer, Detective Captain Shaun Harmse, has appealed to all victims of Facebook related rapes to make contact with him at 082 442 1232 as soon as possible. "The suspect will be appearing before the Motherwell Magistrates Court on Monday on a charge of rape."
