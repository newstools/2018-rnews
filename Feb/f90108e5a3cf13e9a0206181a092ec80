 Humewood police in Port Elizabeth on Monday arrested a 28-year-old suspect in charges of murder. "The arrest followed after the members responded to a complaint at the PE Harbour," said police spokesperson, Capt Sandra Janse van Rensburg. "On arrival, the members were informed that the deceased and the the suspect were both working on a vessel from Mosselbay and they got into a argument when the suspect stabbed the 38-year-old man in the upper body." She said that the name of the deceased cannot be released because his next of kin still needs to be informed. "The suspect will appear in the Port Elizabeth Magistrate's Court in the week on charges of murder."
