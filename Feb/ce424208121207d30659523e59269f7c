 South Africa has a new President following the resignation of former President Jacob Zuma on Wednesday night. RNEWS went on the streets of Port Elizabeth's townships to get the views of locals about Zuma’s resignation. Ayanda Siyona, a resident of Motherwell said: “They managed to force Thabo Mbeki to resign and they also managed to force Jacob Zuma to also resign, so I feel like it’s a habit now because they will do the same thing with the next president. “The ANC chose Zuma to be in the presidential seat and we voted him to confirm or to agree that we also want him to represent the country. My fear is that they will do the same thing with Ramaphosa, it’s like the ANC doesn’t know what it remembered like they were trash,” Siyona said. His wife, however, was excited that Zuma had decided to step down and make way for his Deputy Cyril Ramaphosa. Ayanda Sikrweqe, from Zwide, blamed Zuma for Wednesday night's lightning and thunder.
