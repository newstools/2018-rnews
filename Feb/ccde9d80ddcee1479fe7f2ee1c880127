 Two suspects are expected in court on Monday after they were arrested for murder and rape in East London. According to police spokesperson, Captain Nkosikho Mzuku, the arrests are the result of "determination and diligence" displayed by detective, Sergeant Khulile Mkatali, who went above and beyond to ensure that the culprits face the allegations against them. "This follows after a woman’s body that was found discarded on the street at NU 2 roughly around 07:00 am on Sunday, 21 January 2018," he added. "It is alleged that the deceased was last seen with one of the suspects on her way home from a nearby tavern. "Later, she was found lying helplessly on the street, dead." Capt Mzuku said that expedient initial police investigation was able to track the whereabouts of the suspects, who were apparently on the run. Detectives even hired a private car in tracking down one of the suspects so that he would recognise the police. "The two suspects, 23 and 28 years old, respectively are due to appear in the Mdantsane Magistrate’s Court on Monday on charges of murder and rape."
