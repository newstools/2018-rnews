 The South African Communist Party (SACP) in the Eastern Cape says it is shocked and deeply distressed by the unfortunate and merciless attack of police officials that took place at the Engcobo Police Station in the early hours of Wednesday. "The five police officials were shot and killed by armed criminals "We condemn the senseless killing of five police officials and a retired soldier, what makes matters worse is the continued merciless killings of police officials in the line of duty and greater service to the the nation," said Siyabonga Mdodi, SACP Provincial Spokesperson. "It is our considered view that this attack to the police station and killing of the servants of the people is a reflection of a weak crime intelligence capacity that has been compromised by the criminal corporate capture syndicate. "We are calling for the strengthening and professionalization of security cluster for safer communities and prevent loss of life of our police." Mdodi said that the state must put more efforts in bolstering the security systems in the police stations to ensure the safety of the police officials and the communities. "We are further calling for a swift action to ensure that perpetrators are brought to book," he added. "As the SACP, we wish to convey our heartfelt condolences to the families of the fallen members of police service. We also wish to convey our message of condolence to the Police and Prisons Civil Rights Union (POPCRU) whom all the officials were its members."
