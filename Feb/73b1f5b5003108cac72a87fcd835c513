 President Cyril Ramaphosa on Monday night announced his new Cabinet. Former Finance Minister, Nhlanhla Nene, made a return as new Minister of Finance pending his swearing in as an MP. He was once unceremoniously fired by former President Jacob Zuma and replaced by David (Des) van Rooyen. Former Finance Minister, Pravin Gordhan, who was also sacked by Zuma made a return as Minister of Public Enterprises. Dereck Hanekom, who also was fired by Zuma, made a dramatic return to his Tourism portfolio. So did former Minister of Higher Education, Blade Nzimande, who was also fired after the South African Communist Party (SACP) banned Zuma from speaking at its meetings and events. David Dabede Mabuza, the Premier of Mpumalanga and Deputy President of the African National Congress (ANC), will become Ramaphosa's Deputy as Deputy President. Meanwhile, Minister of Police, Fikile Mbalula, has been replaced by former National Police Commissioner, Bheki Cele. Former ANC Secretary-General, Gwede Mantashe, is the new Minister of Mineral Resources. Dropped from Ramaphosa's new cabinet are Mosebenzi Zwane, who was at Mineral Resources; Des van Rooyen, who was at Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs; Lynne Brown, who was at Public Enterprises; and David Mahlobo, who was at Energy. They had been fingered in corruption and state capture. While many would have wanted to see Bathabile Dlamini gone, she was moved to the Presidency, apparently saved by her ANC Women's League leadership, ANC National Executive Committee (NEC) position, and her struggle credentials. Ramaphosa also extended an olive branch to his competitor in the race to succeed Zuma last year, his ex-wife and former African Union (AU) Chairperson, Dr Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma. She is now a Minister in the Presidency responsible for planning. Ramaphosa's cabinet:
