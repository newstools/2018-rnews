 The North West Provincial Commissioner, Lieutenant General Baile Motswenyane, and the MEC for Community Safety and Transport Management, Dr Mpho Motlhabane, on Tuesday expressed their condolences to the families of three Provincial Tracking Team members, who died in a motor vehicle accident, in the early hours of Tuesday, near in Engcobo. "They also wished a speedy recovery to the fourth member who was seriously injured," said police spokesperson, Brigadier Sabata Mokgwabone. "Contrary to earlier reports, the members were neither in the Eastern Cape to attend a memorial service nor as part of a team assigned to investigate the incident that occurred in Engcobo last week. "They departed from Potchefstroom to Mthatha, Eastern Cape in the afternoon on Monday, to trace a suspect on two cases of murder, one of rape and another one of assault with intent to do Grievous Bodily Harm (GBH) that were reported in the province between 2008 and 2011." According to information available at this stage, reports suggest that the members’ vehicle collided with a stray animal along R61 road near Xholosini village, Engcobo. "Three members died instantly while the fourth one was seriously injured and transported to hospital for medical attention." Lieutenant General Motswenyane, said; "This is an unfortunate and tragic incident in which we lost three of our committed members in the line of duty. We pray that the families and members of the South African Police Service in the province have the strength to endure in this moment of grief."
