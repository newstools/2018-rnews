 After weeks of uncertainty, a decision has finally been made to second a reputable acting Municipal Manager (MM) to the Makana Municipality, the Democratic Alliance (DA) in the Makana Local Municipality said. The Grahamstown-based Makana Local Municipality is among several municipalities in the Eastern Cape that have been struggling with issues of management and service delivery. To complicate matters, the municipality cannot appoint a full time MM due to an ongoing court battle with the previous MM.  "The DA in Makana commends a decision by the Sarah Baartman District Municipality to release Mr Ted Pillay and a resolution by the Council to appoint him as acting MM," described Mlindi Nhanha - DA Caucus Leader - Makana Municipality. "He has been appointed for a period of 3 months. "The DA is relieved and is of the opinion that Mr. Pillay is the best man for the job. We believe in his abilities and his track record speaks for itself. We are however concerned that 3 months may not be sufficient for him to turn the municipality around and a permanent MM must be appointed sooner rather than later." Nhanha said that the DA in Makana, towards the end of last year, urged the MEC for Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (COGTA), Fikile Xasa, to dissolve the Council and hold fresh elections within 90 days. "This would have afforded the voters an opportunity to boot out the corrupt, clueless and inefficient ANC-led administration," he added. "The DA will closely monitor the work of the MM and continue to fight against corruption and for service delivery, especially for the poor. "We call on residents, councillors, staff and labour unions to support Mr Pillay during his tenure at the helm of the administration."
