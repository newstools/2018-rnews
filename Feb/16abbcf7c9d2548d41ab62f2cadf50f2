 South African Revenue Authority (SARS) Commissioner, Tom Moyane, on Tuesday welcome and congratulated Nhlanhla Nene in his re-appointment as the new Finance Minister. Minister Nene was re-appointed in a cabinet reshuffle announced by President Cyril Ramaphosa at the Union Building on Monday night. "Minister Nene is no stranger to the portfolio. In fact, SARS leadership has had a collegial and effective working relationship with the Minister before," Moyane said. "The return to the portfolio provides yet another opportunity for SARS to strengthen its effective working relationship with Minister Nene and the National Treasury in the effort to successfully collect revenue to support the government’s developmental agenda." He said that SARS appreciates Minister Nene’s passion, experience and insightful leadership which will enhance the organization’s commitment to being an efficient and effective tax authority. "No doubt, his leadership will further galvanize the SARS workforce and boost morale in a challenging economic environment." SARS has just crossed the psychological threshold of the R1-trillion mark following the upward increase of the revenue target to R1 217.3 billion recently. "The 14 000 men, women and youth that comprise SARS staff are focused, ready and looking forward to deliver on the mandate under the leadership of Minister Nene," Moyane said.
