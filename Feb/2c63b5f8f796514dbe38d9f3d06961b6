 The National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) in Port Alfred says it has not managed to explain the source of distress flares that were fired off-shore over the weekend. According to Stephen Slade, NSRI Port Alfred station commander, at 17h28, on Saturday, the NSRI Port Alfred launched two sea rescue craft Lotto Challenger and Rescue 11 Alpha following credible eye-witness reports of nine illuminating flares delpoyed at intervals coming from deep-sea off-shore of Port Alfred. "An extensive search by NSRI Port Alfred well into the night including the assistance of Telkom Maritime Radio Services requesting assistance in a search and requesting any information that can assist in identifying the origin of the flares has revealed no signs of any craft, sea going vessels in any distress and the reason for the flares being deployed remains a mystery," he described.
