 A team of prosecutors at the National Prosecution Authority (NPA) is on Friday expected to provide National Director of Public Prosecutions (NDPP), Advocate Shaun Abrahams, with their recommendations on whether the NPA should go after former President Jacob Zuma. Abrahams set a deadline last week for the prosecuting team to report to him on whether Zuma should be prosecuted for charges relating to the so-called spy tapes saga. Upon receipt thereof, the National Director is expcted to advise on the way forward, including the date by which he would advise of his decision. In October 2017, Zuma lost his appeal when the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) upheld a decision by the Pretoria High Court that charges against Zuma should be reinstated. It said that the decision to withdraw the 783 counts of corruption against Zuma was “irrational”. The charges relate to Zuma's relationship with controversial businessman, Shabir Shaik, who was tried and found guilty in 2005 of soliciting bribes from a French arms company apparently for the benefit of Zuma. Zuma and other government officials were accused of taking kickbacks from the purchase of fighter jets, patrol boats and other arms. The charges were first brought against Zuma in 2005, but dropped by the NPA in 2009. The reason was of the charges being dropped was the 'spy tapes' - recordings of phone conversations that apparently showed there was 'political meddling' in the prosecution of the case by Zuma's political rivals. Weeks later, Zuma became president of the country after fromer President Thabo Mbeki had been recalled by the African National Congress (ANC). Zuma was given until end of January to make presentations to the NPA on why he should not face the charges.
