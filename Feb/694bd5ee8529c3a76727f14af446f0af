 The decision that President Jacob Zuma stays or goes now rests with the African National Congress' (ANC) National Executive Committee (NEC). This is after the party’s National Working Committee (NWC), which met for an urgent special meeting on Monday, agreed to refer the matter of Zuma's fate to a special NEC meeting on Wednesday - on the eve of the 2018 State of the Nation Address (SONA). The 107-member NEC, which is led by ANC President, Cyril Ramaphosa after his victory in December, is the highest decision-making organ of the ANC between National Conferences and has the authority to lead the organisation, subject to the provisions of the party's Constitution. After failing to apparently convince President Zuma to step down on Sunday night, the ANC's top six had reffered the matter to the NWC, which is in charge with the day-to-day running of the party but does not have decision-making powers on the future of the President - hence it decided to call for a special NEC meeting . Analysts note that the summoning of the NWC was a clear indication yet that President Zuma won't step down without a fight. According to some political analysts, if new ANC President, Cyril Ramaphosa, wants to maintain the current momentum that he has been building since his election in December, he cannot allow Zuma to be the one presenting the 2018 SONA on Thursday. Last week, however, Parliament said arrangements were at an advanced stage for Zuma to present his SONA - unless they were advised otherwise by the ANC. Zuma, if he still presents his 2018 SONA, he will be doing so with another motion of no confidence in him hanging above his head - the nineth such motion during his tenure.
