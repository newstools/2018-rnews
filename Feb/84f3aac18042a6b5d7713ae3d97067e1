 The Democratic Alliance (DA) in Port St Johns has welcomed a decision to look into the alleged irregular appointment of the current Municipal Manager, Ngamela Pakade. "Proper recruitment processes, as set out in section 54A(4) of the Municipal Systems Act 32 of 2000 as amended, were not followed when the MM was appointed," said Chantel King - the DA's Pheseya Kwenciba Contituency Leader. "The post must be advertised and conventional recruitment processes should follow to fill the post. "This decision was brought about after interaction between the Provincial Department of Cooperate Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta) and the Senior Management of the Municipality. Section 18(2) of the Municipal Structures Act provides that a Municipality must meet at least quarterly." She said that failure by the municipal council to properly constitute council meetings in line with the rules of order, nullifies the council meetings and thus the municipality is not complying with the above provisions. "The African National Congress (ANC) prides itself on the good story that they have to tell, however this is far from a good story," Chantel. "This constitute wasted votes on the ANC, which year on year fail residents of the once tour attraction town of Port St Johns." She said that Mayor Lindelwa Rolobile needs to ensure that proper processes are followed as soon as possible for service delivery to continue. "The chaos that unfolded between frustrated hawkers and the municipality is a clear indication that the ANC-led Port St Johns Municipality is failing residents on a daily basis."
