 The Speaker of the National Assembly, Baleka Mbete, has sent a letter to Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) Leader, Julius Malema, informing him that she has decided to reschedule the motion of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma for Thursday, at 14h00. The EFF had early on applied for a motion of no confidence against President Zuma before he delivered the 2018 State of the Nation Address (SONA). Mbete, in response, had scheduled that motion to the 22nd of February. However, the events of the past week, which saw the SONA being postponed at the last minute as well as the recall of the President by the African National Congress (ANC), have no doubt led her to change her mind. According to Parliament Spokesperson, Moloto Mothapo, the Speaker’s decision was made after consultation with the Leader of Government Business and the Chief Whip of the Majority Party, Jackson Mthembu, and is subject to the National Assembly’s Programme Committee agreeing to the scheduling of a sitting for 15 February 2018. "A special meeting of the Programme Committee is being scheduled for 15h00 this afternoon to deliberate on the matter. "With regard to the EFF request of 3 February 2018 for the vote on the motion to be conducted by means of secret ballot, Ms Mbete said she had determined that voting would be by open ballot," he said. "Section 57 of the Constitution, 1996, directs the National Assembly to conduct its business, among others, with due regard to representative and participatory democracy, accountability and transparency. "Ms Mbete said in her letter that she believed that this decision strengthens Parliament’s efficiency in its oversight of the Executive."
