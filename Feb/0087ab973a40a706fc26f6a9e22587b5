 Reports suggest that one of the controversial Gupta brothers and a business associate were arrested on Wednesday morning when the South Africa's Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation, also called the HAWKS, conducted a raid on the family's home in Saxonwold, Johannesburg. It was not immediately clear, which of the three brothers was brought into custody, but reports also said other Gupta family members were negotiating with the HAWKS about themselves over. The Guptas are accused of benefitting from the so-called State Capture and exerting undue influence on State business through their links with President Jacob Zuma. The family's also been implicated in the theft of millions of rand from the Estina Dairy Farm Project. The farm, which is situated at the remote agricultural town of Vrede, was established to benefit black farmers, but apparently became a cash cow for the Gupta family through alleged corrupt dealings with senior politicians in the Free State. It is alleged that the Free State Department of Agriculture handed the farm to the Gupta family in 2013 on a 99-year lease, a questionable transaction that saw millions of rands being received by the Guptas and their allies. In the same year, the department, under then MEC Mosebenzi Zwane and current mineral resources minister, controversially paid around R220 million to the Guptas, R30 million of which allegedly ended up funding the family’s lavish wedding in Sun City in the North West in 2013. Around R220 million in assets linked to the Guptas have now been seized by the National Prosecuting Authority's Asset Forfeiture Unit (AFU), which took control of the multi-million Estina dairy farm in January. Wednesday's raid is believed to be the continuation of a clampdown on those implicated in State Capture allegations. More to follow...
