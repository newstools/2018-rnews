 Port Elizabeth police and community of Motherwell on Thursday extended a helping hand to the family of a teenager, who body was found dumped in a drain about two weeks ago. A post-mortem has since confirmed that she had also been raped. Ntombikayise Socenywa was a learner at Cingani High School, in Motherwell, at the time of her murder. Her naked body, which had been wrapped in plastic, was discovered on the 10th of February in an open field in NU5 Motherwell. On Friday last week, police and community members gathered in front of the Motherwell Magistrate’s Court and made an appeal to the court to take note of public feeling towards these crimes. The two men, aged 21 and 22 years, who were arrested in connection with the incident on 14 February, appeared before the Motherwell Magistrates Court on the same day and were remanded in custody. On Thursday, pupils and teachers from Cingani High School joined SAPS and donated food to the deceased’s family. Police spokesperson, Captain Andre Beetge, said: “Today, the visibly distraught family welcomed the delegation into their home in NU5, Motherwell, where the goods were handed over to the father, Mzingisi Socenywa.”
