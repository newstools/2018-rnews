 Police in Port Elizabeth recovered two vehicles - one hijacked and the other stolen, and made an arrest within 30minutes after the crimes were reported on Tuesday. In the first incident, a white Mazda Rustler bakkie was stolen in the parking area at Zonke Spar in Motherwell, Port Elizabeth. Police spokesperson, Captain Andre Beetge, said that the stolen vehicle was circulated as stolen immediately after it was reported. “Members of the Kwazakeke Task Team spotted it driving in Daku Street towards Kwazakele. “The vehicle was ordered to stop and the 20-year-old male driver arrested for possession of a stolen vehicle,” Captain Beetge described. “In his possession, he had various keys and remotes of other vehicles, which were confiscated.” Captain Beetge said that in the second incident, a white Nissan NP200 was hijacked at gun-point by three armed suspects at KFC, Njoli Square, Kwazakele, at 13:00. “The 37-year-old driver was ordered out of his vehicle, robbed of his cell phone as well as five new cellphones, which he was delivering,” he added. “The suspects fled with the goods and the bakkie, which was found abandoned about 20 minutes later by SAPS Flying Squad Members close to Boxer Store, Njoli Road, New Brighton.” The 20-year-old suspect will appear before the New Brighton Magistrate’s Court on Thursday.
