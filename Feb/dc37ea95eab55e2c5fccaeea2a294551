 The Democratic Alliance (DA) says it is deeply disturbed by a reply to its parliamentary question, which reveals that 57 South African Police Service (SAPS) members working at Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offenses (FCS) units have criminal records themselves. "We call on Police Minister, Fikile Mbalula, to urgently brief Parliament's Police Portfolio Committee on how he intends to root out these members whose crimes include at least 3 cases of culpable homicide, 7 of common assault, 2 of assault with the intent to do grievous bodily harm, and 1 instance of pointing a firearm," described Zakhele Mbhele MP - DA Shadow Minister of Police. "Other crimes include driving under the influence, reckless or negligent driving, fraud, loss of firearms and defeating the ends of justice and theft. "These are patently not the kind of people, who should be working with children or the victims of domestic or sexual violence." Mbhele said that it is quite clear from the questionable conduct of these members that they cannot be entrusted with the responsibility of addressing the extremely high levels of violence against women and children. "This is an indictment on both the Minister of Police, Fikile Mbalula and the entire SAPS leadership," he added. "It is totally unacceptable that the FCS units has compromised members." He added that DA will hold Minister Mbalula to account to root out these officers and to replace them with untainted individuals who will diligently bring justice to the victims and survivors of sexual abuse and domestic violence.
