 The Democratic Alliance (DA) on Wednesday welcomed reports that the Hawks are swooping in on the Gupta brothers, beginning with an early morning raid on the family compound in Saxonwold, Johannesburg. "However, this is 6 months overdue and if any incriminating evidence has been found at the residence, it would be by accident as the compound would likely have been cleared out months ago," said Zakhele Mbhele MP - DA Shadow Minister of Police. "The Gupta brothers must face up to the allegations of corruption and their involvement in the State Capture. "The investigations and action simply cannot end here and must continue to all those implicated, including key Ministers, such as Mosebenzi Zwane, Des van Rooyen, Lynn Brown, David Mahlobo. Theytoo must answer the allegations and be arrested and prosecuted if needs be." Mbhele said that the Hawks must also ensure that ANC Secretary General, Ace Magushule, is thoroughly investigated for his alleged role in relation to the Vrede Dairy farm project, in which R10 million allegedly went directly to Atul Gupta. "Although the wheels of justice have moved slowly until recently, the raids this morning are a step in the right direction. We cannot however lose momentum," he added. "The country’s crime-fighting bodies must push ahead to ensure all those implicated in stealing from the people of South Africa are investigated and held accountable."
