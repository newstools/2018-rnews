 The African National Congress (ANC) says it is awaiting a statement from President Jacob Zuma following his exclusive interview with the public broadcaster, the SouthÂ African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC), on Wednesday on why he was still holding onto the Presidency despite being recalled by the ANC. According to ANC Spokesperson, Pule Mabe, the ANC has noted the points provided by President Zuma. "President Zuma has affirmed that he has not defied the ANC however does not agree with the decision," he said. "In addition, the President Zuma committed to deliver a statement in response to this decision later today. "The African National Congress will await delivery of this response by President Zuma." Speaking to the SABC, Zuma said that he was not defying the party's order to recall him - and has never defied the party throughout his career, but in communicating its decision to oust him, the new National Executive Committee (NEC), led by Cyril Ramaphosa, had failed to persuade him on why he needs to surrender his position. He went on to say that he believed that they were still negotiating before he was ambushed with a recall. Zuma also went to lengths to explain that the notion of 'two centres of power' that was abolished by the ANC some years back was not a valid excuse as at one time fomer President, Thabo Mbeki, was ANC President while the late former President, Nelson Mandela, was State President. He said they worked well and he does not understand why it has become a problem in 2018. The President emphasized that the ANC needed to explain what he had done wrong and why he was being recalled because as far as he was concerned, he had done wrong. He is expcted to issue an offcial statement on Wednesday afternoon.
