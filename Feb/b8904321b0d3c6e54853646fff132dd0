 Reports suggest that President Jacob Zuma has been served with an official notification of his recall following a marathon special meeting of the African National Congress' (ANC) highest decision-making body, the National Executive Committee (NEC), on Monday. Apparently, ANC Secretary General, Ace Magashule, and his deputy, Jesse Duarte, were assigned by the NEC to complete the task of handing in the letter to President Zuma in Pretoria in the morning. The ANC NEC is due to hold a media briefing on its decision to recall the President at around 2pm on Tuesday. Reports say that Magashule left before Duarte after handing the Zuma recall letter. Twitter has been abuzz as people discuss the latest developments around Zuma's future as South African president. Some social media users accused Duarte of still believing that Zuma will remain in his seat, while some called her and Magashule 'Gupta Stooges' in reference to the controversial Gupta family that apparently enjoyed influence on the President. Still, some reports suggest that the Zuma remains as arrogant as ever and has reportedly told the ANC and the NEC "to do as they see fit" but warning that he would "retaliate" if forced to resign. The 'transitional talks' between Zuma and his Deputy, Cyril Ramaphosa, who won the race to succeed him in December, have dragged on since last week when the 2018 State of the Nation Address (SONA) had to be postponed. At this point, the outcomes of the engagements between the ANC top six and the President have been a matter of speculation and rumour. All eyes will be on the ANC NEC's media briefing this afternoon.
