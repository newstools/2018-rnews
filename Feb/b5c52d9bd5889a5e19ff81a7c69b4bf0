 Eastern Cape Premier, Phumulo Masualle, is expected to deliver his 2018 State of the Province Address (SOPA) with a cloud of uncertainty hanging over his future and that of his cabinet. "The looming provincial African National Congress (ANC) cabinet reshuffle needs to be done as a matter of urgency. The party’s factional battles remain a huge obstacle to progress and good governance in this province," said Bobby Stevenson, Leader of the DA in the Eastern Cape Provincial Legislature. Stevenson said that the biggest drought that this province faces, besides the water crisis, is that of jobs. "As at the end of last year, there were 754 000 people unemployed in this province. This is a key issue that the Premier needs to focus on. He also needs to spell out how the education system is going to be improved as the department is continuing to fail the learners in the Eastern Cape," he added. "Corruption is rife throughout the province. We don’t want to hear nice-sounding words but rather concrete plans to stamp out this scourge so that issues like the Mandela funeral fund scandal will no longer haunt us. "The roads network is in a poor state and this needs to be addressed as well. It is the life-blood of our economy. Healthcare in this province also needs an urgent focus." Stevenson said that the people of the Eastern Cape want hope – hope that their lives will change in a meaningful way. "We will be listening carefully to see if the Premier will put this province on a new path. "The reality is that for as long as the ANC governs in the Eastern Cape, the people will suffer," he added.
