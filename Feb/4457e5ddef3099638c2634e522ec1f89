 Three women, aged   24, 33 and 34 years old, were arrested for perjury on Monday after allegedly lying about their kidnapping and the kidnapping of a 10-year-old child. The apparent kidnappings reportedly happened at about 21:00 on Sunday night at Truckers Inn, in Wells Estate. According to police spokesperson, Captain Andre Beetge, the three allegedly told the police how they got a lift in a taxi before being forced by six males into another vehicle close to Corobrick on the M17 and Swartkops Road. “They were apparently forced to leave a 10-year-old girl behind in a red Toyota Tazz, before being taken to an open field where they were assaulted for no reason, before being dropped off again in Seyisi Street, in New Brighton, Port Elizabeth,” he described. “From here, they contacted police to alert them to the 10-year-old girl still being with the kidnappers. “A kidnapping case was opened at New Brighton and police searched throughout the night and morning for the kidnapped 10-year-old girl.” Captain Beetge said that the police became suspicious and concluded that the story was untrue after ‘chasing the wind’. He said that they arrested the trio, who will appear before the Motherwell Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday. The Motherwell Cluster Commander, Major General Dawie Rabie, expressed that the police renders an essential service to its communities. "Opening false cases not only wastes valuable police resources but also cause police to be distracted from real and serious other crimes that need police assistance,” he said. “Perpetrators will face the law as criminals, and not as victims."
