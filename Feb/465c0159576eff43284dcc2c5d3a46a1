 Is it the end of the Zuma presidency? Speculation is rife across the nation on whether President Jacob Zuma will still deliver this week's highly-anticipated State of the Nation Address (SONA) after the African National Congress (ANC) summoned its National Working Committee (NWC) to Luthuli House for an urgent special meeting. The 20-member committee is tasked with carrying out the decisions and instructions of the National Executive Committee (NEC) and conducting the day to day operations of the party. The urgent specialÂ meeting is expected to happen on Monday afternoon Analysts note that the summoning of the NWC is a clear indication yet that President Zuma won't step down without a fight as the NWC at its last meeting had asked the NEC to ask Zuma to step down on his own. There have also been high-level closed-door negotiations on Zuma's possible exit. The urgent meeting comes after a meeting between Zuma and the ANC's new top six leaders on Sunday night at Zuma's presidential guesthouse in Pretoria apparently led to an impasse according to a Tweet by Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader, Julius Malema. Still, two different in the ANC are also expected to march to Luthuli House on Monday, one calling for Zuma to be left alone and the other gathered to apparently protect the ANC's headquarters. According to some political analysts, if new ANC President, Cyril Ramaphosa, wants to maintain the current momentum that he has been building since his election in December, he cannot allow Zuma to be the one presenting the 2018 SONA on Thursday. Last week, however, Parliament said arrangements were at an advanced stage for Zuma to present his SONA - unless they were advised otherwise by the ANC. Zuma, if he still presents his 2018 SONA, he will be doing so with another motion of no confidence in him hanging above his head - the nineth such motion during his tenure.
