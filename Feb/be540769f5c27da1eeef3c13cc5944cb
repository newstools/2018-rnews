 The Democratic Alliance (DA) on Monday visited the Alice Campus of the Fort Hare University, where students have boycotted classes for more than three weeks as a result of poor living conditions at their residences. "Ablution facilities at the campus residences are dirty and unsanitary and this is detrimental to the health of students," said Hlomela Bucwa MP - DA Member of the Portfolio Committee on Higher Education and Training. "The toilets are also separate from the residences, meaning students have to leave the safety of their residences at night to use them. "This is unacceptable as it is unfair to expect students to compromise their safety for something that should be readily available to them." She said that along with members of the DA Student Organisation, "I submitted a memo to the office of the Dean at Fort Hare, demanding that they address the students’ living conditions". "We can no longer have a situation where students are robbed of their dignity and denied their right to a safe environment," Bucwa added. "Students cannot be expected to perform well in their studies when their living conditions are not up to standard. The DA will fight to deliver adequate and dignified accommodation for students at all South African universities."
