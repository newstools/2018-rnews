 The Office of the Premier in the North West Province has announced that it has so far not received a report from the MEC for the Department of Health regarding issues that are being investigated or have been investigated in the Department. "Members of the public have raised concerns about Mediosa (medical mobile unit) interfacility transfer, including Buthelezi Emergency Medical Services and other procurement related matters raised by the public," said Brian Setswambung, Provincial Head of Communication in the Office of the Premier. "In the wake of these concerns, Premier SOR Mahumapelo has instituted forensic investigations in the Department of Health to get to the bottom of allegations that are being raised. "We have noted with concern an insinuation in Motsweding FM current affairs show between 06h00 and 07h00 on 21 February 2018 to the effect that the Office of the Premier is fingered in some allegations." Setswambung said that the Office of the Premier will not be deterred from proceeding with the forensic investigations, which are critical part of the on-going initiatives to fight greed, crime and corruption. "We can only hope that the allegations made in Motsweding fm are not linked to allegations of a plot to assassinate Premier Mahumapelo by an employee in the Department of Health. The Hawks are currently investigating these allegations," he added. "Currently we do not have any report on the meeting between the Department of Health and the Portfolio Committee. Premier Mahumapelo and the Director General await same from the MEC and HOD respectively. "In respect of Dr Lekalakala’s trip to India, we can confirm that the Premier signs permissions for such trips in principle after an MEC shall have recommended, in this case MEC Masike had recommended that the Premier grants permission for Lekalakala’s trip."
