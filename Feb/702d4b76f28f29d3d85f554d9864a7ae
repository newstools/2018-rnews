 A local chokka fisherman is recovering in hospital after suffering from a suspected stroke out at sea. According to Sarah Smith, National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) St Francis Bay station commander, at 10h35, on Thursday, the NSRI St Francis Bay duty crew were activated after receiving a call from the shore skipper of the Chokka fishing vessel Sea Cat reporting a crew member onboard the vessel suffering from a suspected Stroke (CVA). "Sea Cat was heading towards the Port of St Francis," she said. "The sea rescue craft Spirit of St Francis II was launched and we rendezvoused with the vessel just off Shark Point. "The patient was successfully transferred onto our sea rescue craft and in the care of our NSRI medics he was brought to our sea rescue base." Smith said that the patient, a 53-year-old male from Humansdorp, has been transported to hospital by Private Care ambulance in a serious but stable condition.
