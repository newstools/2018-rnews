 A police officer is never off duty - this was proved true when two Port Elizabeth police officers, who happen to be married, busted thieves as they tried to flee from a local bank with the bank manager's cell phone. The incident happened in New Park, Port Elizabeth, on Friday afternoon. "It is alleged that on  Friday, W/O’s Fafa and LucilleTerblanche of the Mount Road COCC were in the bank when they noticed a suspicious-looking  man walking into the manager’s office," described police spokesperson, Col Priscilla Naidu. "The officers forgot about their personal issues and kept observation on the man. "As he exited the office, the officers confronted him. Just then, the manager ran out shouting that his cell phone is missing." On searching the man, the officers found the cell phone in his possession. She said that the suspect and his accomplice, aged 39 and 40 years old, were arrested and detained on charges of  theft, bribery and assault on police. The Cluster Commander for Mount Road Cluster, Maj Gen Tembisile Patekile commended the members for a job well done and for "their efforts and endeavours in arresting these criminals, who were so brazen to walk into a busy institution unnoticed. Their instincts and actions is an example of professionalism in the SAPS." Police are advising institutions and businesses to monitor people idling about without seeking assistance. "Valuables must never be left on the table or in sight. "If possible, always lock the door when exiting the office," Col Naidu said. "Criminals are very quick in stealing  and had it not been for the officers sharp instincts, the suspects would have slipped away,  unnoticed."
