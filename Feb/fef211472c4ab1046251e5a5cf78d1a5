 Four suspects are expected in court on Wednesday after they were arrested after a vehicle that was used in a house robbery was spotted and searched in Old Grahamstown Road, Swartkops, Port Elizabeth. "This follows after a house robbery took place in Tshangana Street, New Brighton, on Sunday, at 18:30.
