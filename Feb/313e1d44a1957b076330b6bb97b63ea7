 The Democratic Alliance (DA) says it finds it unacceptable that Public Officials and Councillors in the Dr Beyers Naude Local Municipality owe the institution R862 000 in unpaid municipal bills. "This while electricity is being cut off to residents who are in arrears and buy electricity from the Municipality. Customers buying directly from Eskom are, however, being left untouched," said Samantha Graham - a DA Dr Beyers Naude Local Municipality PR Councillor. "If the Municipality wants to impose penalties on its residents for non-payment of services, it must make sure that those penalties are applied fairly and uniformly. To only penalise some consumers and not others, is unacceptable." She said that the Municipality is in financial crisis and only has a month’s worth of cash in reserve. "Furthermore, the collection rate of 85% falls short and should be at least 90%. Even if a 90% collection rate is reached, cash would still be problem because the Municipality budgeted for a 100% collection rate. "Councillors and officials are not the only ones failing in their duty to pay accounts. Non-payment of services by residents, government departments and businesses also play a role," Graham said. "Businesses owe R11 million for services, while National Departments are in arrears to the tune of R4 million. The bulk of outstanding monies, however, are from residents who have not paid for R88 million worth of services." She said that the DA urges the Municipality to act against Councillors and officials guilty of non-payment and to refrain from cutting off services to some of our cash strapped residents.
