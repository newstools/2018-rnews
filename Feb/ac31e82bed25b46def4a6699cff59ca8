 The Algoa Bay Yacht Club, which has until the end of business on Wednesday to vacate its premises at the Port Elizabeth Harbour, has issued an open invite to all local sailors to come along for a last sail. According to Alan Straton, Chairman of the Algoa Bay Yacht Club, the last sail will start at around 17h00. "We have invited all members and fellow sailors to come for a last sail from Algoa Bay Yacht Club," he said. "It may be a good day for photographs and personal reactions from members and supporters. "If you do come along then please chat to Anna-Mari van Vliet - 084 588 3499, who will organise a refreshment or two for you and maybe even a spot on a yacht or a support boat. "I will be sailing a dinghy as my last sail so only available later." Last week, Transnet National Ports Authority’s (TNPA) Port of Port Elizabeth confirmed that it had issued a notice to Algoa Bay Yacht Club to vacate the port on 28 February 2018 in accordance with the terms of a High Court order dated 23 August 2017. This followed a long legal battle between the Algoa Bay Yacht Club, which had occupied the premises over the past 60 years, and Transnet National Ports Authority over rentals. Last week, the Algoa Bay Yacht Club announced that they would meet Transnet in the Port Elizabeth High Court on Friday over the eviction. Transnet has since issued an invite for emerging businesses that meet BBBEE requirements to come to its roadshows, where they will learn about opportunities at the country's ports - including at the Port Elizabeth.
