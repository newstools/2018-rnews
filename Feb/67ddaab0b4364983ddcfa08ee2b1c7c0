 Has the month of Romance and Loveleft you a bit lonesome lately? Fending for your own finances perhaps? “There is nothing comfy about it and can therefore leave you feeling lonely and hopeless,” says Carla Oberholzer, spokesperson at Zeeva. It’s time to put an end to that feeling of isolation and time to stand firm, knowing: YOU ARE NOT ALONE. South Africa has over 25 million credit-active consumers as stated via the National Credit Regulator’s (NCR) Credit Bureau Monitor (Quarter 3, 2017 report). And, the number of consumers with impaired records (currently over 20 million) is increasing daily. Just take time to think about it: you are not the only person struggling with debt, millions have the same problem. THE GOOD NEWS – you don’t have to face the problem all by yourself. Oberholzer recommends three important tips on ‘how to share your debt load’ and not to go it alone: Don’t feel hopeless because of your current debt-filled circumstances.
