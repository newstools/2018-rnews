 Concerted efforts to fight the proliferation of illegal firearms in the Humansdorp Cluster paid off on Friday with the arrest of four suspects for robbery and illegal firearm possession. "Whilst a complainant was busy reporting a case of robbery at about 09:00 on Friday, that had allegedly occurred earlier on the N2 in the district of Port Elizabeth, he noticed a vehicle driving past Thornhill, that matched the description of the red Toyota Tazz  that was allegedly used by the same four suspects that robbed the complainant," described police spokesperson, Captain Gerda Swart. She said that WO Louw and Sgt Felix  responded immediately upon receiving the information and pulled the vehicle off in the small town of Thornhill. "By means of a  thorough search that was conducted, a Rossi 38 Special with ammunition was found in the possession of the suspects, as well as a small quantity of dagga and property belonging to the complainant (cellphone and clothing)," Capt Swart said. "The four suspect, ages between 22 - 36 year old, were arrested on charges ranging from the illegal possession of a firearm and ammunition, illegal possession of drugs and the possession of suspected stolen goods." She said that the suspects are due to appear in the Hankey Magistrate’s Court on Monday,  on the respective charges. The suspects will also appear in the Port Elizabeth Magistrate's court soon on a charge of robbery. "The firearm, of which the serial number was scratched off, will be sent for ballistic testing to ascertain whether it was used in the commission of other crimes," said Capt Swart. The South African Police Service will continue with their Back to Basics approach, with the aim to intensify operations in order to ensure the safety of all citizens. Humansdorp Cluster Commander, Brigadier John Lebok, thanked the complainant for his alertness and the  members for their efforts and vigilance in ensuring that they bring those culprits who break the law, to book.
