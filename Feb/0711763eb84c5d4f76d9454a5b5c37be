 The Department of Labour will this week host three penultimate worker engagement/briefing sessions on the implementation of the national minimum wage (NMW) and amendments to labour legislation in the Eastern Cape. According to the Department, worker briefing sessions are part of the national roadshows that started last year to engage workers on the implementation of NMW. "The briefing sessions are also intended to educate the workers on the implications of proposed amendments to the Basic Conditions of Employment Act (BCEA), the Labour Relations Act (LRA), the coming into effect of the Accord on Collective Bargaining and Industrial Action and the Code of Good Practice on Collective Bargaining, Industrial Action and Picketing," it said. "The initial briefing session on Wednesday (07 February) will be held at the Savoy Hotel, Nelson Mandela Drive in Mthatha. "The second briefing session will be held on Thursday (08 February) at Premier Hotel Regent 22 Esplanade – Beachfront in East London. The Eastern Cape leg of briefing sessions will culminate on Friday (09 February) at Boardwalk Casino - Beach Road, Summerstrand in Port Elizabeth." Worker engagement/briefing sessions started on 9 November 2017 in Johannesburg. This was followed by further briefing sessions in  Pretoria, Cape Town, George, Pietermaritzburg, Richards Bay, Durban, Tzaneen, Polokwane, Mbombela, Emalahleni, Klerksdorp, Rustenburg, Bloemfontein and Welkom. "A new National Minimum Wage is set for implementation from 1 May 2018. The agreed national minimum wage at NEDLAC is pegged at R20 an hour for major sectors, with the exception of sectors such as farm workers, domestic workers and expanded public works programme workers," the Department said. The ultimate two briefing sessions are lined up as follows: in Northern Cape at Upington (15 February), and in Kimberley on (16 February). The briefing sessions on NMW and amendments to labour laws are held from 10:00-13:00.
