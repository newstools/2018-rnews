 After a lengthy trial, the Mdantsane Magistrate's Court, in Mdantsane, East London, sentenced a 24-year-old man to a combined 27 years behind bars for burning his own mother to death during an argument over money for drugs. According to the SAPS' Mihlali Kobe, Siphosethu Nzuzu was handed five years imprisonment for arson; seven years for attempted murder and 15 years for murder. "The sentences will run concurrently. "Siphosethu was arrested on grounds of being aggrevated by the refusal of his mother, Nomonde Nzuzu (55), to his financial plea to cure his drug addiction in their NU9 home, Mdantsane," described Kobe. "After such disappointment a furiated young man took it upon himself to 'punish' her, profusely pouring petrol all over her and thus setting her alight until she passed on. "Collaterally, he left his 18-year-old brother, Siphamandla Nzuzo, with crucial burns." Vulindela Station Commander, Lt Col Monde Mgolodela, commended the investigating officer for securing this hefty sentence. "I am not surprised by this wonderful conviction secured by WO Xolile Mbidlana. He is one of the experienced, hard working and dedicated investigators in my team. I am so proud of him," he said.
