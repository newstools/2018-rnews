 Two men accused of kidnapping a 71-year-old woman from Sterkstroom during an armed robbery at her home last week Tuesday appeared in the Sterkstroom Magistrate's Court on Monday where the case was postponed to Monday next week for a formal bail hearing. Mrs Denise Bartlett, who is also a local businesswoman, was apparently kidnapped after arriving home with her granddaughter from her business. "Both were assaulted and the old woman was taken by pepetrators, who managed to take an undisclosed amount of money and her green Chevvy Spark vehicle and drove away with her," said police spokesperson,Â Captain Namhla Mdleleni. Local police then launched a manhunt for the suspects and managed to locate her vehicle abandoned outside the town. Mrs Bartlett was only found on Friday in one of the suspects' house. The two suspects, Raymond Fillis, aged 37 years old, and Marlon Conellus, aged 45, were arrested.
