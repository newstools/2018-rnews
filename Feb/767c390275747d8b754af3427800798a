 Former Minister of Police, Fikile Mbalula, has now been redeployed by the African National Congress (ANC) as the Head of Elections at the ANC Headquarters, Chief Albert Luthuli House, in Johannesburg, with immediate effect. Mbalula, who was once a Minister for Sport before being re-assigned to the Police Ministry, lost his position to former Police Commissioner, Bheki Cele, following a cabinet reshuffle by President Cyril Ramaphosa. "This appointment follows a decision of the special National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting held on Sunday, to deploy several Chairpersons of committees to Luthuli House in line with resolutions of successive national conferences to expand and strengthen the organisation’s capacity to execute the tasks and demands of the current phase of the revolution," said Jessie Duarte, Deputy Secretary General, African National Congress. "Comrade Fikile Mbalula has served the movement for many years with utmost determination and commitment, having served as both the Secretary General and President of the ANC Youth League for almost a decade. He has also served as a member of the Cabinet for over a decade, recently serving as a Minister Police." Duarte said that the ANC is confident of Comrade Mbalula’s leadership at the helm of our elections machinery  as we advance towards a landslide victory in the 2019 National Elections.
