 Justice was finally served when the Tsomo Regional Magistrate's Court on Thursday sentenced a 23-year-old man to 20 years behind bars after convicting him of a rape that happened at the end of 2014. Siphosethu Faniso was convicted of raping a 13-year-old girl on 14 November 2014, at about 14:00, at Ndaba Locality, Nqancule Village, Ngqamakhwe, said police spokesperson, Captain Jackson Manatha. "The accused took the victim from his mother. He was armed with a knife," Captain Manatha described. "He dragged the victim to his home where he raped her." The Butterworth FCS Unit investigated the case and later arrested him.
