 As safety month continues, the Aliwal North police say on Thursday they managed to remove eleven suspected criminals from the community of Sterkspruit during their searches and patrols. According to police spokesperson, Captain Ursula Roelofse, a total of 576 vehicles were searched by police officers and fines to R5 000 were issued in addition to the arrests. “The multi- disciplinary operation was held from 07:00 up until 11:00. The focus was on tracing of suspects, undocumented people, and illegal possession of dagga and traffic offences,” he described. The operations began on the R726 where a roadblock was held and after that stop and search activities continued into Sterkspruit town. “Role-players that participated included the traffic department of Sterkspruit and Zastron, municipal police and the SANDF that assisted the SAPS.” The Cluster Commander Brig Xakavu commended the members on the good work done. It is the responsibility of the SAPS "to make sure that our communities are and feel safe and we will work together with all other law enforcement agencies to eradicate crime and to make a difference in our communities".
