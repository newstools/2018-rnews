 Will he accept defeat and resign or will he choose to defy his own party? After a protracted process where the African National Congress' (ANC) highest decision making body, the National Executive Committee (NEC), tried to persuade President Jacob Zuma to leave office honourably and hand over power to his Deputy, new ANC President, Cyril Ramaphosa, the NEC on Tuesday  finally resolved to recall him. Zuma had refused to resign and had apparently asked for up to six months to sort out his affairs. ANC Secretary General, Ace Magashule, said that on Monday night, he went with Ramaphosa to meet Zuma "to convey that we were not agreeing with the time of 3-6 months". "Cde Zuma pleaded that given the challenges confronting the ANC, that the ANC NEC reconsider the time frame. The NEC felt that we couldn't wait for that period and that President Ramaphosa needed to take over and ensure a smooth transition," he told the media on Tuesday. "If you listen to President Ramaphosa speak, he always emphasises that radical economic transformation is a resolution of #ANC54. Our trajectory on radical economic transformation will not change, regardless of who is leading the ANC. "The decision of the #ANCNEC to recall Cde Zuma is final. It can't and will not change. We will treat Cde Zuma with dignity and we will not humiliate him. Zuma is now expected to address the nation on Wednesday morning, but as he had been refusing to step down, it is anyone's guess whether he will fight his recall and defy his party or will simply accept defeat and walk away. Meanwhile the party Chief Whips are expected to meet in Parliament. Opposition parties had been gearing for an impeachment in Parliament later this month if the ANC had failed to remove Zuma. Last week, Parliament was forced to postpone the 2018 State of the Nation (SONA) at the last minute. The ANC's Parliamentary Caucus is also expected to meet today to discuss Zuma's recall.
