 Motherwell residents and local police on Friday joined hands against the brutal rape and murder of a 15-year-old girl in Motherwell. This followed after Ntombikayise Socenywa’s naked body was found wrapped in plastic in a drain at an open field in NU5 Motherwell. At time of the discovery, police didn’t know her identity, but suspected that she had been raped before being killed. Police spokesperson, Captain Andre Beetge, said that a post-mortem was conducted, which has since confirmed the police’s suspicions. “On Wednesday 14 February 2018, two male suspects aged 21 and 22 were arrested at 14:00,” Captain Beetge added. On Friday community members, the police, Community Police Forum members, local pastors and youth forums joined hands in a public outcry against incidents like these.

Afterwards, the group of about 200 residents gathered in front of the Motherwell Magistrate’s Court in an appeal to the court to take note of the public feeling towards such violent crimes.
