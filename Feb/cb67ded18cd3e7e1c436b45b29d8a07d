 Police in Mthatha have appealed for information that can assist them in getting back their Search and Rescue dog that went missing at Mahlubini locality in Sulenkama on Sunday, at about 19h00. The dog, Olive, went missing after he rescued a 55-year-old man, who had gone missing on Friday, when he went to fetch wood at a nearby forest. "Olive was allegedly chased by other dogs whilst his handler, Constable Songezile Katikati and members of the community were about to reach their vehicle," said police spokesperson, Captain Dineo Koena. "Constable Katikati and Olive were together since 2012. The two were awarded the 'Best Rescuing Dog' in the Eastern Cape in 2014, 2015 and 2016." Constable Katikati, who has been disturbed by the incident, said, â€œOlive is my best friend and companion. He is humble and he cannot harm anyone as he is trained in rescuing drowned people, seeking missing people and seeking evidence on other crime scenes. I plead with anyone who sees him to not harm him but rather keep him and report to the police." Captain Koena said that Olive is a German Shepherd Dog, tan in colour with his black back and face. He has a black leather belt with clock around his neck. "Olive is our member that never disappointed us. When we send Constable Katikati and Olive to rescue someone we relax and stay assured that they'll bring that missing person back to his/her family. It is therefore disturbing news to our Cluster and other Clusters to hear that he is missing. Our members have since been out there searching for him," said the Acting Cluster Commander, Brigadier Nomawethu Makonza. Police are urging anyone, who might see him or know of his whereabouts to please contact Constable Songezile Katikati on 07273101556 or 0835303295. Information can also be shared on SAPS Crime Stop 08600 10111 or Crime Line 32211.
