 National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete has confirmed that she received former President Jacob Zuma’s resignation letter on Thursday. “The Speaker of the National Assembly has received a letter from President Jacob Zuma informing her of his resignation as the President of the Republic of South Africa,” said the Speaker’s office. According to Parliamentary rules, the letter of the President will be officially published in the parliamentary Announcements Tablings and Committees (ATC) journal, for the attention of Members of Parliament. The resignation of the President is effective immediately. Effectively, this changes the agenda of today’s sitting of the National Assembly, which was from considering a proposed Motion of No Confidence in the President, to that of electing a President. “This has necessitated that the election of the President, which was initially scheduled for Friday, 16 February 2018, be changed to today at 14.00,” said Speaker Mbete. The Speaker has also been informed by Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng of his availability to preside over the National Assembly’s election of the new President this afternoon. Following a successful election, the Chief Justice will then swear in the new President. “We thank President Zuma for his service to the people of South Africa in the last eight years and wish him well,” said the Speaker. Parliament also confirmed that following the changes, it has altered its programme for the next few days: -      SAnews.gov.za
