 The African National Congress (ANC) Caucus in the Eastern Cape Provincial Legislature at Bhisho on Tuesday welcomed the election of its new Chief Whip, Honourable Fundile Gade. "Honourable Gade joined the Eastern Cape Provincial Legislature in 2014, and has served as the Chairperson for the Education Portfolio Committee to date," the party said. It said that, in light of the changes to the composition of the ANC Caucus Members of Provincial Legislature, which culminated in the swearing in of two new MPLs, the following changes will come into effect: "The ANC Caucus bids a warm-hearted farewell to the outgoing Chief Whip â€“ Honourable Mzoleli Mrara, who has served the Eastern Cape Provincial Legislature with honour and esteemed prestige. Honourable Mrara was charged with the responsibility of stabilising the financial viability of the ANC Caucus, as well as ensuring political stability of the Caucus and the Legislature," it added. "We hold the view that he has met and exceeded these expectations, as he leaves an administratively and financially stable ANC Caucus which possesses the political will to take centre stage in determining the course of the Eastern Cape Provincial Legislature. "We wish Honourable Mrara all the best in his future endeavours, and express our most heartfelt gratitude for the role that he has played in shaping the thinking and development of the Caucus and Legislature to effectively respond to the needs of the Eastern Cape citizenry. His teachings will forever resound in our daily activities in ensuring a better life for all."
