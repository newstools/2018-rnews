 The Coega Development Corporation (CDC) has announced that on 22 February 2018 it would launch its inaugural Supplier Development Day event-taking place at the Vulindlela Accommodation and Conference Centre (VACC) in Coega. The event, which is an initiative of the CDC, seeks to facilitate access to information for Small Micro Medium Enterprises (SMME’s) on opportunities as well as Enterprise Development Programmes. Furthermore, the Supplier Day serves as a networking and information-sharing platform, bringing together SMMEs, big business, academia and industry. “Since announcing the CDC Supplier Day this week, we have received many enquiries from small business wishing to register for the event,” says Unathi Maholwana, CDC SMME Programme Manager. The CDC Supplier Day, which is a first of its kind by a Special Economic Zone, will include an impressive lineup of speakers from both the private and public sector. “We’ve cast our net wide, appreciating the diverse sectors in which the CDC has a footprint in. As a result, it’s important that the lineup of speakers is reflective of that,” says Dr. Ayanda Vilakazi, CDC Unit Head: Marketing, Brand and Corporate Communications. The activities at the VACC will commence with registration at 7:30am followed and will start at 9:00am. Some of the speakers include captains of industry coming from the financial sector, ABSA, Standard Bank & Small Business Finance & Support. Mindful of the procurement opportunities available in the public sector, the CDC has included speakers from public institutions such as the South African National Treasury, South African Revenue Services as well as representatives from the BEE Commission; all of whom will be engaging small businesses on a multitude of issues in relation to the development of small business in the region.
