 Eastern Cape police confirmed that four people were taken for questioning as part of investigations over the killing of five police officers at the Ngcobo police station and a retired soldier early on Wednesday morning. According to police spokesman, Captain Khaya Tonjeni, police have also taken note of “speculations and false reports” made on social media and mainstream media that they had arrested the suspects. “Ever since the Task Team was formed, a lot of ground has been covered and a lot of progress achieved.   There is some great support from the public in different ways on different platforms. “People will be questioned and this will not be done differently in this case,” he said. Captain Tonjeni also added that a formal announcement will be made should there be any significant development on the side of the investigation. “In the meantime, we will refrain from reporting any further miniscule details on the progress of the case investigation. We will wait until there is something tangible and meaningful. “We have decided to respect the process of the investigation and allow the work of the Task team to continue without any further challenges or miscommunication,” he said. Meanwhile, the police have released the names and photos of the five policemen who were killed in the attack.
