 Police Minister, Fikile Mbalula, has welcomed the conviction of former Western Cape SAPS Provincial Commissioner, Arno Lamoer, for corruption by the Western Cape High Court on Monday. According to the Police Ministry, earlier in the month, Lamoer pleaded guilty to a charge of corruption. However, he was not found guilty of racketeering and money laundering. "The conviction sends a strong message that no one is above the law. It also instills confidence in the country's criminal justice system that criminals will face the might of the law," said Mbalula. The Minister also reiterated the Police Ministry's resolve to root out corrupt elements among police ranks. "We need police who must understand that their job is a calling, that they have a duty to serve and protect people of the Republic of South Africa," Mbalula added. Lamoer was charged with corruption, racketeering and money laundering along with three former police Brigadiers, Sharon and Kolindren Govender, as well as Darius van der Ross and Goodwood businessman, Salim Dawjee. Minister Mbalula called upon South Africans to continue to be a critical source of information in fighting corruption in South Africa and the Police service.
