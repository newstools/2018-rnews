 Farmers association, Agri Eastern Cape, on Wednesday added its voice in condemning the attack on the Ngcobo police station, in Engcobo, and subsequent murders of five SAPS officers and one soldier, "in the strongest possible terms". "As an organisation, Agri Eastern Cape has a close working relationship with rural police stations throughout the province and we are deeply saddened by the senseless killing of these officers. We extend our heartfelt condolences to their families and loved ones," said Alfonso Van Niekerk, Chairperson: Rural Safety Committee at AgriEC. "This cold-blooded and cowardly crime is not merely an isolated incident. Its effect on rural policing in the Eastern Cape has far-reaching consequences and puts the safety of SAPS personnel, the entire rural community and farming families at risk. "We would urge the Honorable Minister, Fikile Mbalula, to appoint task teams to investigate the murders. The culprits must be apprehended and charged, and the judiciary must impose maximum sentences to send a clear message that attacks on those who would protect their fellow South Africans will not be tolerated." Van Niekerk said that Agri Eastern Cape and its members will assist the SAPS in any way possible with their investigations "and we call on members of the public, who may have any information pertaining to the case to contact the relevant authorities or phone SAPS Crime Stop on 086 00 10111".
