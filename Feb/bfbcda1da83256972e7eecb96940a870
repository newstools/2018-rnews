 Rain is expected over the entire Eastern Cape this weekend, including Port Elizabeth and the catchment area, the South African Weather Service's Port Elizabeth office said on Wednesday. "At this early stage, falls of around 10 mm are forecast over the city and its main catchment area. This could be adjusted upwards or downwards as the weekend approaches, depending on how the system develops," said Garth Sampson, Client Liaison Officer for the Eastern Cape at the South African Weather Service. "There are unfounded rumour doing the rounds that in excess of 100mm of rain is expected and that it will lead to the cancellation of the EP Herald Cycle Tour. No such warning has being issued by the South African Weather Service." He said that, at this stage, the majority of rain is forecast to fall overnight Saturday through to Sunday, the weather office does not expect the rain to have any drastic effect on the event. "The situation could change as the week progresses and it is being monitored by the South African Weather Service. Regular updates will be posted when and if changes to the forecast are expected," Sampson said. Visit www.weathersa.co.za for the latest official forecasts and warnings.
