 As the criticalÂ  water situation continues, the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality is calling on all residents and stakeholders, who had been granted Water Restriction Concessions (exemptions) to re-apply, as the old exemptions are no longer valid. "Failure to re-apply and continuation of water usage in terms of the old exemption will result in the Municipality imposing water restriction penalties," said Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality Spokesperson, Mthubanzi Mniki. "This will not only hit the affected consumers' pockets hard;, it will also force the Municipality to install water meter restrictors on the relevant properties to limit usage." This follows the announcement of Water Restrictions Notice 4 late last month. In terms of Water Restrictions Notice 4 the following must be adhered to: "In addition to the legal requirements aimed at conserving our limited water resources, all residents are encouraged to limit their water consumption to 50 litres per person per day and households to limit their overall consumption to 400 litres per day or 12k? per month," Mniki said. Additional stricter measures imposed, of particular important to high domestic users, contractors and borehole users, are as follows: He said that with immediate effect, the Municipality will enforce by-laws around water consumption at car washes and residential complexes. These include that: Reapplication for concession can be made to waterrestrictions@mandelametro.gov.za.
