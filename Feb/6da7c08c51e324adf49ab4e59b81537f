 Forecasters are monitoring the weekend rain situation carefully, considering the drought situation over the Eastern Cape, the South African Weather Service said on Thursday. "If and when there are changes expected, updates will be forwarded and posted," said Garth Sampson, Client Liaison Officer for the Eastern Cape, at the SA Weather Service. "Rain is still forecast for most of the Eastern Cape from Saturday afternoon through to Sunday. "Although the models are not agreeing entirely, we are forecasting around 10 mm in the Port Elizabeth area and surrounds. "The heavier falls are only forecast for areas East of East London." Sampson urged residents to visit www.weathersa.co.za and listen to the radio for the latest updates.
