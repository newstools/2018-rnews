 Police in Uitenhage have issued an urgent warning to residents not to be naïve when responding to job adverts either in the newspapers, telephonically or on social media. "This alert is issued after it has come to our attention that communities receive a telephonic call from a person claiming to be a police Captain from SAPS Uitenhage," said police spokesperson, Captain Gerda Swart. "The ‘bogus’ cop will inform the receiver on the other side that if they are between the ages of 18 – 35 years old, they may apply for vacant posts at the Uitenhage police station in Church Street. "The ‘policeman’ will arrange meetings with his clients and also request that an amount of R2 500 must be paid to secure a specific vacant post." The acting Station Commander for Uitenhage, Colonel André Swart, refutes such applications in such a manner. He explained that the South African Police Service will always advertise vacancies (posts) in the newspapers or on its official website and interested recruits will only apply in writing at our Human Resource Management Department, situated in Chase Street, Uitenhage and there is a strict policy on recruitment, which they abide to. "The application form is available only at the recruitment office and clearly states that it is ‘not for sale.’ "The SAPS will never recruit telephonically or request any form of money. Anyone, who might have received this type of notification for a vacancy must ignore it and deem it as a fraud or a scheme," said Captain Swart. "Never commit to any payment. Application forms when advertised is free and under no circumstances, money is requested. For more information on recruitment, kindly visit our website or your local HRM SAPS office."
