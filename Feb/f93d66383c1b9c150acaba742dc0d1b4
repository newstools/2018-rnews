 The Tsomo Regional Magistrate's Court last week convicted and sentenced 29-year-old Phumlani Mahlathi to undergo twenty years imprisonment for raping a 64-year-old woman more than two years ago. According to police spokesperson, Captain Jackson Manatha, the accused, who was sentenced on Thursday, is alleged to have approached the 64-year-old woman on 11 August 2015, at about 19:00, at Sihlabeni Village, Ngqamakhwe. "The accused was armed with a sword. He threatened the victim and raped her," Captain Manatha described. "The victim was staying alone." He said that the Butterworth Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences (FCS) Unit later traced and arrested the accused. Eastern Cape Police Provincial Commissioner, Lt General Liziwe Ntshinga, welcomed the sentence. She praised the investigating officer of the case for properly investigating the case.
