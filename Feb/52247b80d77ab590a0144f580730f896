 Willowvale police swiftly arrested an alleged rapist on Sunday, at dawn, after he fell asleep after apparently raping a woman he abducted from a local tavern. "It is alleged the suspect, aged 25 years old, dragged a 28-year-old woman on Saturday during the evening. The victim had just gone outside when the suspect appeared from amongst the cars outside the tavern," described police spokesperson, Captain Jackson Manatha. "The suspect, who was armed with a knife allegedly dragged the victim to his house around Willowvale town. "It is alleged that he raped her and thereafter fell asleep. "It was at that stage the victim woke up and run to Willowvale Police Station where she broke the silence." Captain Manatha said that Willowvale police wasted no time and went to the house of the suspect with the victim. "They found the suspect fast asleep and he was arrested." The suspect has been charged with rape and will appear before the Willowvale Magistrate's Court on Tuesday.
