 The State's first witness at the trial of controversial Nigerian televangelist and Senior Pastor of the Jesus Dominion International (JDI) church, Timothy 'Tim' Omotoso, Cheryl Zondi has officially launched a foundation to support women and children, who have been abused. Zondi detailed how she joined the church and was later sexually abused by Omotoso at his Durban home. She also linked one of Omotoso's co-accused, Lusanda Solani, to the abuses. Still, the accused refused to plead to all the charges against them. Zondi kept her Instagram followers in suspense on Monday as she told everyone to be on the lookout for an important announcement, which she will deliver on Tuesday morning. Zondi said that her new foundation is called the Cheryl Zondi Foundation  - turning point into purpose. She said that the foundation was started for the purpose of supporting women and children, who have been mentally, emotionally, spiritually and sexually abused in sacred spaces. Cheryl Zondi Foundation aims to assist abused women and children "Running public awareness campaigns to make the public aware of this kind of complex abuse, assisting the families and friends of the victims caught in these abusive circumstances with psychological and legal support, assisting victims through a legal process if and when they want to take legal action against their perpetrators and pioneering changes in the legal system to make it work better for victims," he wrote in her Facebook page. "We aim to dynamically change the narrative of anonymity associated with shame and self-blame around abuse and institute adjustments and modifications to consecrate sacred spaces and make them sanctified again, bringing healing to the nation as we do so."
