 Three suspects managed to evade arrest after hijacking a furniture delivery vehicle in Zwide, Port Elizabeth, on Thursday. According to police spokesperson, Captain Andre Beetge, Kwazakhele police swiftly responded after receiving a report that a furniture vehicle, a white Toyota flatbed bakkie, had been hijacked by three suspects using a white VW Golf. "Just after 15:20, the driver and his assistant were about to deliver a mattress at a house in Magi Street, Zwide, when a white VW Golf stopped in front of them,” he said. “Two suspects got out while the driver remained in the golf." Captain Beetge added that two suspects, one armed with a firearm, then instructed the driver at gunpoint to drive the bakkie while his assistant was left at the scene of the incident. "The assistant notified the SAPS of the hijacking and after 10 minutes, the vehicle was spotted by Kwazakele police in Boxongo Street, Kwazakele,” he described. "A short vehicle chase ensued until the two suspects jumped from the furniture vehicle and managed to evade arrest. "The firearm they were using was dropped next to the vehicle in the process and discovered by SAPS as a toy gun.” ‘Police treat toy gun and real firearm crimes the same’ He added that the 55-year-old driver sustained an injury to his head when the suspects pistol-whipped him in the hijacking process. “Nothing was taken by the suspect.” Motherwell SAPS Cluster Commander, Major General Dawie Rabie, has warned criminals that "using a toy gun to commit a crime still qualifies as using a firearm in terms of the Firearms Control Act. “SAPS will use the same procedures in dealing with armed suspects, whether it is a real fire arm or a toy gun.” He added that the SAPS will continue to focus on crimes committed using firearms and will use the full force of the law to ensure such criminals are brought to book.
