 Port Elizabeth police on Thursday morning arrested two armed robbery suspects in Summerstrand after they were apprehended by members of the public for allegedly robbing a 38-year-old woman. According to police spokesperson, Colonel Priscilla Naidu, it is alleged that on Thursday, at about 07:40, the woman was standing at the corners of Erasmus and Admirality Way waiting for a taxi to go to work. “Two unknown men were standing with her. Suddenly, one pulled out a firearm while the other produced a knife. “They threatened her and took her handbag, cellphone and personal items before running off,” she described. Luckily a person passing by saw her screaming and accompanied her to the police after she explained what happened. “On their way to the police station, they noticed a group of people and a security official with two men lying on the ground in the parking area of Pollock beach.” Col Naidu said that the woman recognised the suspects. “All her stolen items were in their possession. A member of the community also seized a .38 revolver and the knife. “Both suspects, aged 26 and 30 years old, were apprehended and detained on charges on armed robbery, the illegal possession of a firearm and the illegal possession of ammunition," she said. “Police will be investigating whether the suspects could be linked to other crimes in the area. They are expected to appear in court soon." The Cluster Commander for Mount Road, Maj Gen Thembisile Patekile, has commended the community for their swift response and for immediately coming to the aid of the distraught victim. “Fighting crime is a shared responsibility and the speedy mobilization of the community this morning shows that they (the community) are definitely the eyes and ears of the police," added Maj Gen Patekile. “Their action resulted in the arrest of the suspects. I urge the communities to continue working in close partnership with the police because together WE can do more."
