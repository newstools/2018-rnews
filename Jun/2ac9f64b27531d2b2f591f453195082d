 The Port Elizabeth Commercial Crimes Court rejected an application by former African National Congress (ANC) Ward 20 Councillor, Bongo Nombiba, to be granted leave to appeal his conviction and sentence on Monday. Nombimba is serving a five-year jail sentence after the court found him guilty of fraud and money laundering in March. After Magistrate Lionel Lindoor rejected the bail application, Nombiba’s new attorney, Advocate Vuyisile Calaza, from Mthatha, said that they will not give up as they have decided to petition the Port Elizabeth High Court. The date for the petition is yet unknown. Nombimba was sentenced to five years imprisonment by Magistrate Johannes Claassen, founding him guilty of fraud and money laundering. Nombimba, from Kwazakhele, was accused of swindling the municipality of the money, which was part of a donation to an organisation caring for the elderly. He first appeared in court in December 2016. According to the State, Secretary of a local non-governmental organisation (NGO) called Thulamangwane Community Project that renders services such as caring for elderly people and cleaning schools in the community, Zukiswa Mbhem, and Deputy Chairperson, Mandisa Monco, with other members, approached the Councillor to request a R10 000 donation from the municipality as financial assistance for the NGO. It is alleged that Nombimba instructed the group to put their request in writing, but not to mention the amount that they had requested, which they did in September 2014. The State claims that Nombiba then forwarded the request to the Metro for an amount of R30 000, which was apparently meant for the organisation. In November 2014, the Metro deposited R30 000 into the NGO's Standard Bank Account. However, Nombiba told the NGO that of the R30 000 deposited - R10 000 was what the NGO requested and the R20 000 was his. That is when the fraud came to light.
