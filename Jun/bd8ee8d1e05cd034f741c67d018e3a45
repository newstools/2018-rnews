 After yet another Nelson Mandela Bay Council meeting collapsed on Wednesday, African National Congress (ANC) councillors used that opportunity to address hundreds of municipal workers, who were waiting to hear Council’s resolutions on their demands. The striking workers downed tools on Thursday last week led by the municipality's largest union, South African Municipal Workers' Union (SAMWU), downed tools, and delivered their demands at the City Hall on Friday. On Monday, another union, the Independent Municipal and Allied Trade Union (IMATU), also downed tools. The ANC's Andile Lungisa said that the ANC will continue to support the strike until the workers get their back pay. “We will not operate, even the councillors of the ANC and the office of the ANC will not do any work until the dispute of the workers of this Metro is resolved," he said. “We will be with you every day. All 50 ANC councillors are standing by you." While addressing the workers, Melikhaya Korjan, from SAMWU, said that the Democratic Alliance (DA) led coaition has shot themselves in the foot. “The DA is doing these things and we see it, which is good because 2019 is around the corner and this is an own goal to them," Korjan said. “If we were angered in 2016 and went to vote for other parties, we can see clearly now what happens when we vote for other parties."
