 The National Assembly and National Council of Provinces has mandated the Constitutional Review Committee to review section 25 of the Constitution and other sections where necessary, to make it possible for the state to expropriate land in the public interest without compensation. The committee is required to propose the necessary constitutional amendments. Members of the public are invited to submit comments on the proposed review by Friday 15 June 2018. The Constitutional Review Committee will also hold public hearings from 26 Junie 2018 to 6 Augustus 2018 in all provinces across the country. Section 25 of the Constitution sets out the requirements that must be met when the government expropriates private property rights. Section 25 gives the government the power to expropriate property, but only when it is for a public purpose (like building a road) or in the public interest (which in terms of section 25(4) includes land reform). This must be done in terms of a law of general application (such as the Expropriation Act of 1975) and against payment of just and equitable compensation. Parliament appointed a panel of experts to assess the current legislative framework. The High Level Panel on the Assessment of Key Legislation and the Acceleration of Fundamental Change reported as follows: (Extract from the Executive Summary -https://www.parliament.gov.za/high-level-panel) Contact us if you require advice on your property related matters.
