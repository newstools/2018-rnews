 History was made at the Boardwalk International Conference Centre in Port Elizabeth on Friday, as business delegates from South Africa and China came together to create partnerships and sign cooperation agreements at the China-South Africa Business Forum. Attending this auspicious event was the Nelson Mandela Bay Executive Mayor, Athol Trollip, and the Premier of the Eastern Cape Phumulo Masualle, as the Chinese Ambassador to South Africa, Lin Songtian. “I would like to welcome Ambassador Lin Songtian to Nelson Mandela Bay, it’s the second time he’s come to this city and we appreciate our relationship,” said Trollip. Among the projects and agreements signed, some of which are still in discussion, were the Friendship Cooperation Project, the Business Cooperation Project, and the South African Beef Import Strategic Cooperation Project. “We set out to look for new investments, some agreements of which we have seen today. It’s a relationship that we are looking to run for years because there is quite a large market there that could use some of the products that come from our country,” said Premier Masualle. “What we are doing now is knocking businesses into each other so that from there we will have deals that can get entered into with the businesses. “Altogether, we are looking at six agreements that are going to be signed today, but some are still in the final stages of discussion.” The delegates were then led on a tour of the Coega Special Economic Zone (SEZ), to see how the partnership between South Africa and China has been progressing, particularly in the motoring industry. They were also shown the deepwater Port of Ngqura and toured the Nelson Mandela University.
