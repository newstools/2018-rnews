 Port Elizabeth police arrested a 26-year-old after a high-speed chase, which ended when the suspect crashed into the perimeter wall of a house. According to police spokesperson, Captain Andre Beetge, New Brighton police were busy with crime prevention duties and wanted to pull a white VW Polo off the road. “The vehicle didn't have a front number plate and the back number plate was false. “When the vehicle sped off, the police members called for back up and a high speed chase ensued through New Brighton," he described. “The SAPS Flying Squad joined in the chase and managed to keep up with the vehicle until the driver lost control of the vehicle and it collided into the wall. He attempted to run from police but was arrested after running a few metres." Captain Beetge also said that the driver pointed the police with a firearm, which led to a shootout as police officers tried to defend themselves. Fortunately, no one was injured. “Inside the vehicle, two school bags and two cellphones were also found, which was robbed from children in Ikamvelihle earlier that morning. The robbery cases were made by their parents at Ikamvelihle. The VW Polo was hijacked on 4 June 2018 at 05:15 by three suspects in Belmont Terrace, Central," Capt Beetge said. “The 26-year-old suspect will be facing charges of pointing of fire arm, possession of stolen vehicle, possession of stolen property and reckless and negligent driving. More charges could be added once he is linked with the hijacking and the robberies.” He will appear before the New Brighton Magistrate's Court on Monday.
