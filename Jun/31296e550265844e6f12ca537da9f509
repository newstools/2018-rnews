 No-one likes thinking about – let alone discussing – death, and this dislike seems to extend also, for many of us, to our Wills. However, all too often our Wills have been drafted many years ago, are out of date, not legally sound or practicable and really need wholesale revision. Perhaps you Will was not drafted by a suitably experienced and qualified Estates planning professional, such as an Attorney who specialises in this field. Take out your Will, and ask yourself these questions: If the answer to any of these questions is “yes”, or “I’m not sure” – or if you don’t have a Will at all – you should make an appointment urgently to discuss your Estate planning with us. Contact the Estates Department at Goldberg & de Villiers Inc on 041 501 9800 to set up an appointment.
