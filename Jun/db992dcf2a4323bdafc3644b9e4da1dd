The other three managed to evade arrest and fled on foot. Nobody was injured during the exchange of fire." Capt Beetge said that the 41-year-old suspect will be charged for theft and possession of stolen property. He will be appearing in the New Brighton Magistrate's Court on Friday. SAPS Motherwell Cluster Commander, Major General Dawie Rabie, applauded the arrest and added "Our community needs to assist police in identifying these suspects.
