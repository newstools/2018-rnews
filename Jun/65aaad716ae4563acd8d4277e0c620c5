 Kwazakhele police arrested two shopkeepers on Friday morning after they allegedly shot at a customer at their shop in Mabopa Street, Kwazakele, Port Elizabeth. According to police spokesperson, Captain Andre Beetge, “Just after 10:00, two shopkeepers were busy offloading stock when a client (victim) wanted to buy something from their shop. “After telling him to wait, an argument ensued after which one of the shopkeepers allegedly produced a firearm and shot at the client. Fortunately, the victim was not hit.” He said that an attempted murder case was opened by the victim, and on searching the shop, police found a live 9mm cartridge on the scene and a 9mm firearm hidden behind a toilet in the shop. “Both shopkeepers were arrested for attempted murder and possession of an unlicensed firearm and ammunition. The cartridge and firearm will be analysed by forensics,” Capt Beetge added. “The two suspects, aged 27 and 22 years old, will appear before the New Brighton Magistrate’s Court on Monday.”
