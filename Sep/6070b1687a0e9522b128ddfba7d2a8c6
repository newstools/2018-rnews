 The Patriotic Alliance's (PA) Councillor, Marlon Daniels, who on Thursday announced that his party had decided to dump the Democratic Alliance (DA)-led coalition in the Nelson Mandela Bay, says that the party will do what the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) are doing in the Metro – supporting and observing Mongameli Bobani’s administration. Councillor Daniels said that while the DA led-coalition was busy talking about winning their court case, which could see them back in power, he was watching what was happening. "We were quiet and in silence, but on the ground and everybody had something and everything to say while we just monitored, who was saying what,” Daniels told RNEWS. He added, based on his observations, he noticed that the DA was making everything about an individual – the former Mayor, Trollip. "When there is a coalition agreement, it can never be about an individual, it has to be about everybody, who formed the coalition and, who is part of the relationship,” Daniels added. "Another thing that we, as the PA, have realized is that the DA cannot help itself anymore, they are appearing as if everything is about them. "Who said that minority parties cannot govern? Why must it be big parties that govern Metro?” He said that the PA took a decision way back when they supported the removal of Trollip “that its time for minority parties to govern”. Daniels further said that the Bobani administration has not made any promises to the PA, but they still chose to support the new administration. "We don't have an issue observing how they are managing the Metro, the EFF is doing that - they are supporting the government of the day, but are not part of that government," he said.
