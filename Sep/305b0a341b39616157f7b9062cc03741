 Democratic Alliance leader, Mmusi Maimane, on Wednesday said that it is not just former President, Jacob Zuma, who should be blamed for the economic recession now faced by South Africa, but the entire African National Congress (ANC) leadership. Maimane was speaking in Port Elizabeth where he announced that former Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality MMC for Human Settlements, who is also the DA's Eastern Cape leader, Nqaba Bhanga, as the party's candidate for Premier in the 2019 Provincial and National Elections. Ahead of the announcement, on Wednesday morning, several newspaper articles blamed Zuma for the recession the country finds itself in after Stats SA announced on Tuesday that the economy had shrunk by 0.7% in the second quarter of 2018. However, Maimane said that it is wrong to blame Zuma alone for the mess as many ANC leaders protected him and refused to admit that he was bad the economy of the country for years. "I read this morning, a newspaper headline saying 'Blame Jacob Zuma for recession'. Even myself, I don't like Jacob Zuma, but he cannot take the blame for the recession," he explained. "The only party to blame for the recession is entire ANC because they protected him, they looted together - so if someone ought to be blamed for recession, it's got to be the ANC." He said that it is too late for finger-pointing now. On Tuesday, he called for an urgent debate in Parliament to discuss the recession.
