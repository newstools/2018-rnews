 After two years of water restrictions, Nelson Mandela Bay residents can breathe a sigh of relief after the Metro announced on Friday that it was lifting Section 2C water restrictions that carried with them punitive tariffs for those caught abusing the Bay’s then dwindling water supplies. "It will rain until March", Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality MMC for Infrastructure, Engineering, Electricity & Energy, Andile Lungisa, told the media on Friday at a 100-days service delivery plan announcement event held in New Brighton, Port Elizabeth. At the event, Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality Executive Mayor, Mongameli Bobani, announced his new administration was lifting the tariffs due to the recent rains. Bobani said that the amount of rain falling in the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality’s catchment areas had doubled since the ouster of former Executive Mayor, Athol Trollip. He added that the Metro was not lifting the water restrictions altogether but was moving to Section 2B restrictions, which are not as punitive as Section 2C. "Although we are still in the grip of prevailing drought conditions, recent rain increased our dam levels substantially,” he told reporters. “This enables us to reduce water tariffs from Plan C back to Plan B. “However, while water tariffs will be reduced, residents are urged to be always cautious and use water sparingly.” Bobani added that the municipality’s water augmentation programme is continuing with the implementation of Phase 3 of the Nooitgedacht Low Level Scheme. Section 2B water restrictions charges & tariffs (Applicable during times of water shortage) (Excl. VAT) Part C Charges & Tariffs (Applicable during times of water shortage emergency) MMC Lungisa emphasised that the weather outlook shows that it will be raining until March, so local residents must be spared the burden of continuing to pay high water tariffs until further notice.
