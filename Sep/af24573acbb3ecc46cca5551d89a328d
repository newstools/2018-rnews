 The Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality on Monday welcomed news that the rains that fell in the region helped to bring up the dam levels in the drought-stricken Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality. According to Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality spokesman, Mthubanzi Mniki, said that the Metro is very appreciative of the 29.99% impact the rains had on the dam levels in Bay catchment areas. "Reports have indicated that in some areas more than 100 mm of rain and up to 200 mm have been recorded," he said. The overall impact is as follows: Last week, the average dam levels was 18.02%. Although the there is a difference made, however that doesn’t necessarily mean that residents must stop saving water. “As can be seen that the average dam levels have improved, but the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality by no means are out of this disastrous situation especially thinking of the amount of rain that has fallen," Mniki said. “The Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality will be monitoring the true impact of the rain over the next few days as significant runoff is still taking place." He added that local residents and business are still encouraged to remain vigilant and save water.
