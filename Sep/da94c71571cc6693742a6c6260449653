 There is still no indication on whether Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality Municipal Manager, Johann Mettler, still holds his post or if he has been suspended despite Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality councillors debating since Thursday morning. Besides a brief exchange on Thursday morning between Democratic Alliance (DA) Eastern Cape leader, Nqaba Bhanga, and the Economic Freedom Fighters’ (EFF) Zilindile Vena, the Council Meeting continued from where it left off on Tuesday. The DA’s Goergen Gustav Miggels was also at one point eject from the Council Chambers by the Speaker, Buyelwa Mafaya, for apparently talking to the Speaker without being addressed. Councillors briefly debated the appointment of a new Chairperson for the Rules & Ethics Committee. The African National Congress’ (ANC) Andile Lungisa nominated EFF councillor Lukhanyo Mrara to take up this position. However, Vena asked that the item be withdrawn from the agenda so that it can be debated in the next council meeting, which was supported by other councillors. The item was withdrawn. Johann Mettler's future debated The public gallery was then asked to leave the Council Chamber to afford Councillors the opportunity to deal with the matter concerning the future of City Manager, Johann Mettler. This follows allegations of misconduct levelled against Mettler. Councillors were expected to take around an hour to hear Mettler’s response as to why he should not be suspended. It has been over six hours and there is no word about what is happening in the Council Chambers. During a tea break, Bhanga only hinted that they were showing the Mongameli Bobani led administration "what it really means to be an opposition party”. More to follow...
