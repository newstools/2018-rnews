 Outside and inside the Port Elizabeth High Court, in Port Elizabeth, it was packed as Democratic Alliance (DA) supporters came in their numbers to offer support and follow the proceedings as the DA and its coalition partners seek the reversal of the appointment of the United Democratic Movement's (UDM), Mongameli Bobani, as Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality Executive Mayor. Bobani subsequently appointed a Mayoral Committee composed mainly of African National Congress (ANC) Councillors. Former executive mayor, Athol Trollip, who is leading the DA coalition's challenge, took an opportunity to thank the DA supporters. "They are going to hear you in 2019 and 2021, we are DA because we take away corruption in the city," he said to much applause and cheer. "The UDM will never win a ward against the ANC, the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) will never win a ward against the ANC, our coalition partners are going to be the alternative government in the Nelson Mandela Bay." Trollip urged the supporters to continue the unity because when there is unity people get scared. Even if the DA and coalition partners win the court battle, it remains to be seen if they will be able to hold onto power after their other coalition partner, the Patriotic Alliance (PA) announced on Thursday that it was switching side again and routing for Bobani. So far, three DA councillors have also indicated they are leaving the party andthe ANC claims more councillors will leave the party soon.
