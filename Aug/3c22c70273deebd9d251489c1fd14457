 Controversial Nigerian televangelist and Senior Pastor of the Jesus Dominion International church, Tim Omotoso, briefly appeared before the Port Elizabeth High Court on Thursday. Omotoso faces over 60 charges relating to sexual exploitation, racketeering and human trafficking. He is alleged to have sexually abused several young women at his church in Umhlanga, Durban, under the pretext of healing them. The disgraced man of cloth has been languishing at the St Albans Correctional Facility since his arrest on the 20th of April 2017 by the Hawks shortly after he landed at the Port Elizabeth International Airport. He had tried evading arrest for days when the scandal came out. At the airport, the 59-year-old pastor had apparently tried to avoid arrest by first lying about his flight's arrival time then hiding in public toilets when he found armed officers waiting for him. He later made two attempts to get bail, which failed. Two women, who are alleged to have been responsible for recruiting and grooming girls for the 59-year-old Pastor, Lusanda Solani (36) and Zukiswa Sitho (28), were also arrested last year. Omotoso and his two co-accused appeared at the Port Elizabeth High Court for a pre-trial conference on Thursday. Judge Dalayin Chetty, who is now presiding over the case, postponed it for trial, which will start on the 8th of October. It is expected to be concluded by the 14th of December.
