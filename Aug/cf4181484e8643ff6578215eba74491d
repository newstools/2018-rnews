 The much-anticipated opening of the new Nelson Mandela Bay Yacht Club has been postponed. Ruben Rosales, the General manager of the Club says, “Although we could open the restaurant on the planned date of 1 September, we have want to spend more time training our team, perfecting our menu and adding some final finishing touches to the building.” He adds, “We know how popular the old restaurant was and we want to make sure that we not only meet people’s expectations with our new restaurant, but that we give them an experience above and beyond what they have had in the past.” The old Algoa Bay Yacht Club building which will be the home of the new Nelson Mandela Bay Yacht Club, has been renovated, invigorated and the best of the old features have been upgraded. Improvements include the instillation of air-conditioning and heating to the interior restaurant, a greatly improved downstairs area with place for kids to play and a waiting station, more seating throughout the restaurant, refurbished toilets and facilities to cater for the various boat charter businesses and cruises. “We have a great menu, highly experienced chef and restaurant team and a capable waiting team.  We want to spend a little more time making sure that that they all come together to create a wonderful experience for our patrons,” concludes Ruben.
