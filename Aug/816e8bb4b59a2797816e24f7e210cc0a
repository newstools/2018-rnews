 "The African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP) will oppose any move to allow the state to be custodian of all land," the party's national leader, Kenneth Meshoe, described in a statement. Meshoe expressed concern over President Cyril Ramaphosa's announcement on Tuesday night that the African National Congress (ANC) had resolved to amend the Constitution to allow for expropriation of land without compensation. On the other hand the ACDP, believes that the move to amend the Constitution is just politicking by the ANC ahead of the 2019 elections. The party says it is also worried about how food production, agricultural development and the economy will be affected during the process. "We believe that this decision is irresponsible and premature given that the parliamentary public hearings have not been concluded, and the more than 500 000 written submissions have not yet been considered by parliament. "We are further disappointed that the president decided to ignore warnings from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) who have also confirmed that land expropriation without compensation will impact the economy negatively," Meshoe described He added that the party supports orderly land reform based on restitution and ‘just and equitable’ compensation being paid in accordance with section 25 of the Constitution. "The ACDP will also oppose any move to allow the state to be custodian of all land. We are concerned that the ANC is not giving title deeds to emerging farmers and urban residents," Meshoe said. "While the ACDP appreciates the need for land reform and restitution, we also understand the need for nation-building, peace and reconciliation. We will thus oppose the ANC’s proposal to amend the Constitution."
