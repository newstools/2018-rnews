 The Motherwell Boxer Superstores branch celebrated their birthday on Thursday with a campaign to create awareness about women and child abuse. Boxer Superstores celebrates its birthday in August, coincidentally the same month that South Africa observes Women's Month. Employees at the store began with a march and were joined by drum majorettes. They later assembled at the store where a group judges, gave them marks based on cleanliness, uniform, specials, food freshness etc. Masixole Mofu, one of the store's employees, said that working for the store gives him great pleasure because they are not only regarded as employees, but are treated like family. "Today, is hectic because we are trying to impress the judges as well as do our daily work duties so I'm nervous," he described. Customers were met by a group of dancing children outside the store, who held placards calling on them to help end the scourge of women abuse.
