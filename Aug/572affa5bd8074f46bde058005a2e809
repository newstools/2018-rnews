 Political parties and individuals, who plan to disrupt the Isuzu IRONMAN 70.3 World Championships, which will be hosted by Nelson Mandela Bay on the 1st and 2nd of September, will be punished dearly, Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality Executive Mayor, Athol Trollip, warned. Trollip said that he has also wrote a letter to President Cyril Ramaphosa over possible disruptions to the event. "I wrote a letter to the the president of South Africa, Cyril Ramaphosa, to say that there are two the African National Congress (ANC) and United Democratic Movement (UDM) Councillors that are instigating to disrupt the Ironman championships. "The world 70.3 Ironman championships is not a city event anymore it is now an international event with 5 000 athletes coming here, the biggest gathering of foreign nationals since after the World Cup. "Any incidents that disrupts or will potentially disrupt the Ironman would be an embarrassment to this country." The Mayor said that the country cannot afford such bad publicity as it desparately needs to address high youth unemployment - and boosting tourism is one of the solutions. He also revealed that he not only spoke to Ramaphosa, but to the Minister of Police, Bheki Cele, the Minister of State Security, Dipuo Letsatsi, as well as the local SAPS management, to ensure that the international visitors are safe. "We have political parties and individuals that are going around stirring up strife to get people to disrupt the Ironman championships and we are not going to accept that," Trollip emphasized. "Those that don't go along with us will be punished."
