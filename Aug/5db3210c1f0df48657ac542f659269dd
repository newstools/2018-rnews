 Below are questions that a home buyer should ask to avoid costly surprises. Costs: Zoning rights: Check the zoning of the property to make sure that you may use and improve the property that you intend to buy as planned. Restrictive conditions in the title deed of the property: If you plan to improve the property by building on or by building a granny flat, make sure that the conditions in the title deed do not restrict your plans. Building plans: Request the seller to show you the approved building plans of the property to make sure that the existing building have been approved. Pets: If you are buying in a sectional title complex or complex governed by a home owner’s association, are pets allowed or do you need consent to keep pets?
