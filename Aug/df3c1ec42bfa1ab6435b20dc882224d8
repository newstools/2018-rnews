 Nelson Mandela Bay opposition parties are on Friday expected to petition Council Speaker, Jonathan Lawack, to schedule a Special Council Meeting soon at which they will try again to remove theÂ Executive Mayor, Athol Trollip, and his Mayoral Committee. "Our national leaders didn't sleep in the table of brotherhood; it has always been us, who thought that we had everything under control, but now that our national leaders are on board, we are 100% sure that this will change the game," said United Democratic Movement (UDM) Regional Leader, Mongameli Bobani. He was once the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality's Deputy Executive Mayor until last year when he had a fallout with Trollip, who has so far survived two attempts to remove him - one in November last year and another one early this year. However, Bobani is confident that this tim,e there is no way Trollip will survive. "Come Friday, we will hand in our petition to the Speaker and there will be no need to vote because a petition differs from a motion especially now that we have our much needed 51%," he described. On Thursday, there was a meeting between the opposition parties, which was also attended by Gayton Mckenzie, leader of the Patriotic Alliance (PA), which saved Trollip the last time a motion of no confidence was brought against him. The PA's Councillor, Marlon Daniels, ended up being appointed the new Nelson Mandela Bay MMC for Roads and Transport through an 11th-hour deal struck between the Democratic Alliance (DA) led coalition and the PA. Bobani said that the smaller opposition parties are determining how this will go this time after the official opposition, the African National Congress (ANC), said it does not want the position of Executive Mayor once Trollip is gone. The ANC is, however, supporting the petition. He said that the reason for the new move against Trollip is because of the "drop of service delivery in the Metro's townships".
