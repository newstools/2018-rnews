 Local taxi associations are still debating on whether to increase fares after the South African National Taxi Council (SANTACO)  announced that taxi fares will go up by between R1 - R10 in line with the latest petrol price increase. Mzwanele Qwabe, Vice Chairperson of Ncedo Taxi Association in Port Elizabeth, says that they have not yet concluded discussions over whether to increase fares and by how much. Ncedo Taxi Association is affiliated to SANTACO. "We are still in heavy negotiations and we won't increase now until we have done negotiations," he told RNEWS. "We are living in a community where there is high employment and before making any announcement or coming to a conclusion we have to note that." He still said, however, petrol price increases impact directly on their business, so they will have to make adjustments. "When petrol increases, everything else increases, tyres, cars, car parts everything else will increase, therefore if we finally come to that conclusion of announcing the increment our passengers must know that it wasn't an easy decision to make."
