 A 58-year-old man, who allegedly raped a 2-year-old baby on Sunday, is recovering in a local hospital after he was apparently attacked by angry residents in St Francis Bay. He was only saved by St Francis Bay police, who rushed him to the hospital after being brutally beaten. According to police spokesperson, Sergeant Majola Nkohli, the suspect's girlfriend, who is also the nanny of the 2-year-old child, left the child with her boyfriend. "It is believed that a suspect raped the baby after his girlfriend momentarily left her with him. It is said that a suspect's girlfriend was a childminder, and she went out to the shop leaving a baby with her boyfriend (suspect)," he described. Sgt Nkohli added that the police responded after receiving a complaint of a baby found abandoned in the bushes near the Sea Vista area, in St Francis Bay, on Sunday afternoon. "On Monday, after a medical report confirmed sexual violation, police opened a rape case for investigation, with a possibility of additional charges at the later stage of the investigation." That is when the residents found the suspect and severely assaulted him. "The 58-year-old suspect is under police guard in hospital," Sergeant Nkohli added. He said that the suspect will appear in the Humansdorp Magistrate's Court as soon as he recovers from hospital.
