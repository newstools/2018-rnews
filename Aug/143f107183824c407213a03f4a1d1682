The Principal arrived at the school on Wednesday night before local firebrigades were called. "The matter has been reported to the local police as there is strong evidence of arson. I therefore appeal to the public to please help the police in their investigation, through their cooperation to ensure if there is any foul-play, those involved are brought to book.
