 The Eastern Cape Department of Education says it suspended two middle managers with immediate effect on Thursday following allegations of corruption. According to the department's spokesman, Mali Mtima, this followed after an internal investigation that indicated that there were payments made to service providers prior to services being rendered to the department. The reason for the drastic act is stop corruption and fraud in the Eastern Cape Department of Education, Mtima added. "The department will investigate the matter further, and where it is found that (more) undue payments have been made, steps will be taken to recover those funds," he described. Mtima said that the department will also blacklist the alleged service providers from doing business with government. "Whilst the department appreciates the role played by service providers in the delivery of critical services, it is also determined to deal with unscrupulous service providers." The Eastern Cape Department of Education's Head of Department (HoD), Themba Kojana, cautioned employees to act morally when conducting government business. "This is a direct violation of the Public Finance Management Act, and we will never tolerate such! We promise the tax-payers that we will root out corruption within the department and any illegal collusion between officials and service providers. This will be done to ensure that public finances are utilised efficiently and appropriately within the bounds of the law," he said.
