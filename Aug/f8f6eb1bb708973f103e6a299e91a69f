 Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality Executive Mayor, Athol Trollip, got a reprieve on Thursday after a special Council Meeting to debate his future at the helm of the Metro had to be postponed due to disagreements among councillors. Six opposition parties, the African National Congress (ANC), the United Democratic Movement (UDM), the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), the African Independent Congress (AIC), the United Front (UF) and the Patriotic Alliance (PA) want Trollip and the entire Democratic Alliance (DA)-led coalition removed from office. The opposition parties had a combined 61 seats in the 120-seat Council against the DA-led coalition's 59 seats, which includes seats from the African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP) and the Congress of the People (COPE). However, the PA on Wednesday night decided not to vote against Trollip and the coalition following a spat with the EFF, which would effectively bring voting to a stalemate. In that scenario, Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality Council Speaker, Jonathan Lawack, from the DA and who also faces a motion against him, will then have to cast the deciding vote – which will obviously secure the DA coalition’s win. Thursday's gathering, like previous attempts to oust Trollip, witnessed shouting battles among councillors leading the Speaker to announce a postponement after a quorum could not be reached as opposition parties ended up leaving the council chambers. Lawack will have to announce a new date for the meeting... More to follow.
