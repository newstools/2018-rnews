 Two police Constables, 39-year-old Baatile John Murambiwa and 44-year-old Thebeethata Reginald Mandlane, made a brief appearance at the Ventersdorp Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday for corruption after they were arrested by the Hawks’ Serious Corruption Investigation unit on the same day. "The pair, who are stationed at Ventersdorp police station, were arrested following investigations into a complaint alleging that on January 9, 2018, they stopped and searched a delivery van with furniture," said police spokesperson, Captain Tlangelani Rikhotso. "Some of the items were apparently not listed on the inventory. "The officers then allegedly threatened the driver with arrest and demanded a R550-00 bribe. The money was subsequently deposited by the owner into one of the suspects' account." Captain Rikhotso said that they were granted R500-00 bail each. "The case has been postponed to 25 April." The Provincial Head of the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation, Major General Linda Mbana, has warned police officers to desist from abusing their authority. “Those who prey on innocent people will face the full might of the law,” she said.
