 Cabinet has urged all parties in the public transport sector involved in wage negotiations to act speedily so the bus strike gripping the country can be resolved. Now in its second week, the bus strike has left thousands of commuters stranded, with many being forced to use other modes of more expensive transport. Parties deadlocked and the Department of Labour is expected to weigh in to speed up the negotiations. Bus drivers are demanding a 9.5% salary increase in the first year and 9% in the second year. They initially demanded 12%, with their employers offering 7%. At their meeting this week, Cabinet Ministers were briefed on the current public service wage negotiations and the bus strike. Addressing a post Cabinet media briefing in Cape Town on Thursday, Communications Minister Nomvula Mokonyane said Cabinet wants all wage negotiations to be urgently concluded. “Cabinet calls on all stakeholders in the public transport sector to bring a speedy end to the national bus strike. We urge all parties to return to the negotiation table so as to reach an agreement that is in the best interest of all parties and the country,” Minister Mokonyane said. In the public sector, wage talks have already dragged on for more than seven months. The eight unions that represent teachers, nurses and other State workers have warned they won’t tolerate any more delays. – SAnews.gov.za
