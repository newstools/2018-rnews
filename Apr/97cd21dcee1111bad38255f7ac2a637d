 The Department of Labour has learnt with serious concern that there is wrong information being distributed and shared in the media that the Acting Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Labour, Ms Sharome van Schalkwyk has said the National Minimum Wage and other related Bills have been returned to the Department because of her dissatisfaction with them. The department of Labour Director General, Thobile Lamati said, "This is incorrect and misleading. "The fact of the matter is that since the Portfolio Committee was conducting its own public hearings, it has consolidated all comments and suggestions received, both verbal and written and then handed them to the parliamentary legal officer and the state law advisors to redraft some of the changes that have been agreed to during the deliberations of the Committee." Lamati said the Department as the originators of the Bills are working with the parliamentary legal officers and state law advisors to redraft the Bills. "After effecting some of the changes, the Bills will be sent Â back to the Portfolio Committee for further processing", the Director General said. The Director General said the Department of Labour is ready and always available to provide accurate and first hand information on the National Minimum Wage.
