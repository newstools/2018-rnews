 Eastern Cape SAPS Provincial Commissioner, Lieutenant General Liziwe Ntshinga, welcomed the forty years imprisonment handed down to a convicted rapist by the Grahamstown High Court. “That’s the only place where this sadist who has caused irreversible damage and lifetime scars on these two young children belong. This sentence should send a clear message to other would be offenders. Leave the children alone and let them play!” she said According to police information, 51-year-old Andries Van Wyk was convicted on two counts of rape and sentenced in the Grahamstown High Court on Friday. He was handed 20 years imprisonment for each count. The sentences will run concurrently. "During early May 2017, two friends, aged 6 and 7 years old, were playing in the yard at one of their grandmother’s home Hogsback near Alice. They are unrelated. Both their grandmothers had gone to a funeral at a local village," described police spokesperson, Captain Mali Govender. "The accused who was home, lived with one of their grandmothers. The accused gave both the children wine and whilst they were inebriated, he took turns to rape them. "One of the witnesses who was drinking with the accused the previous day went to him with the intention of having a drink with him when he witnessed him naked with both the children." Capt Govender said that hee apparently told his wife to go to the house and see what was going on and did not explain the details. "His wife accompanied by her friend, were met with the sight of him holding one of the children over his naked body." The matter was reported to the SAPS and the suspect was arrested the same day. The case was investigated by the Alice Family Violence Child Protection and Sexual Offence Unit.
