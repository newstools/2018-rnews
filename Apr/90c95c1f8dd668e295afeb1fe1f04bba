 The George Municipality on Tuesday advised the public that as part of the ongoing nationwide strike action, a protest march will take place on Wednesday, 25th April. The South African Federation of Trade Union (SAFTU) announced on Monday that on Wednesday, the union and its affiliates will be on the streets of South Africa in a general strike in protest against government's new National Minimum Wage. "The march is scheduled to start at 09h00 – 13h00. The protestors will march from the old Skatelab building, York Street to the George Municipal Civil Engineering Department (corner of York and Market Street) to hand over a memorandum," said Chantel Edwards-Klose, George Municipality Manager: Communications. "The march will then turn around and proceed back down York Street, turning left into Nelson Mandela Boulevard towards the Department of Labour. "From there they will proceed to Thembalehtu where they will disperse.  Please note no roads will be closed during the march." She said that fake Whatsapp messages are doing the rounds indicating that people must stay at home and keep their children from school. "Please note this is an organised protest march with marshalls. Law Enforcement and SAPS will be present at all times."
