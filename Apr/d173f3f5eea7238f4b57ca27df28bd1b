 Air conditioning is not just about heating or cooling the air around you – it’s about refining the interior atmosphere. Unregulated thermal comfort can have a detrimental effect on well-being, morale and even mental or physical health, which can impact on productivity in a working environment.[i] The World Health Organisation says that the standard warm temperature for normal, healthy adults who are appropriately dressed should be 18ºC and for those who have respiratory problems or allergies; the temperature should be 16ºC. A minimum of 20ºC should be used for the sick, elderly, disabled or very young.[ii] Mike van Lier, Director of Consumer Electronics, Samsung South Africa, says, “Innovative technology puts the ‘conditioning’ right into air conditioners. Since the 1920s when movie theatres used their cooler air as a selling point, technology has moved towards creating more than just cooler or warmer air. We’ve moved on to creating healthier indoor environments that refine and condition the air, removing harmful toxins or bacteria. An example of this is the PM2.5 Filter that keeps the air clean by capturing 99% of ultrafine dust in 100 minutes. It also covers 100% of the air inlet, so it completely filters all of the air coming in.” In addition to clearing the air of impurities, Samsung’s Wind-Free™ technology uses 21,000 micro-holes to gently spread air evenly throughout the room, maintaining a comfortable temperature, without any unpleasant direct airflow. So, no drafts. In line with energy saving requirements, Samsung’s world first digital Inverter 8-Pole compressor consumes only 32% of the energy used by conventional air conditioning models, saving 68% of energy usage. It maintains the desired temperature without frequently turning on and off, so it’s much quieter, more durable and efficient. The fast cooling feature cools the air 43% faster, using a triangular architecture to disperse air further and more widely. “Customer centric innovation lies at the core of our brand promise and this product pivots around this very approach. The new technology is especially designed to cater to consumer's specific needs and preferences." concludes van Lier.
