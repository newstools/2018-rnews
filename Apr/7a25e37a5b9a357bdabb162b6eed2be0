 The Democratic Alliance (DA) in the Eastern Cape on Tuesday urged Eastern Cape MEC for Education, Mandla Makupula, to urgently prioritize the needs of learners with disabilities in the Eastern Cape. "A response to a parliamentary question reveals that 1 164 learners with disabilities are on the waiting list to attend schools in Nelson Mandela Bay," said Edmund van Vuuren, the DA's Eastern Cape Shadow MEC for Education. "Another response indicates that the vast OR Tambo region only has five special schools. Many do not have a hostel facility to accommodate special needs learners who do not reside within a close proximity of the schools." Van Vuuren said that the latest Statistics South Africa report on Vulnerable Groups reveals that the Eastern Cape has the third highest percentage of children living with disabilities in the country (14,5%). "Children who are not attending school in rural areas mostly indicated that they do not attend because they are disabled or unable to perform at school. 12,2% indicated that they have a disability which prevents them from attending school," he added. "All children have the right to an education and a child’s access to education cannot be denied because of an uncaring and irresponsible government."
