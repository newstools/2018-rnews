 Eastern Cape Department of Sport, Recreation, Arts and Culture (DSRAC) MEC Dr. Pemmy Majodina on Monday visited the hospitalised boxing champ, Simphiwe Vetyeka, who was injured in a hit and run car accident in East London on Sunday. “The boxing community is very sad to hear about these painful news. Boxers are the role model of our communities and they should receive the necessary respected but instead they get hurt by their own people. "It was unfortunate that the accident occurred when he was still in celebration mood upon knockout win over Thompson Mokwana and the driver sped off. The family should take courage at this sad moment, as the proverb says, a boxer stumbles and falls but gets up again,” said Majodina.
