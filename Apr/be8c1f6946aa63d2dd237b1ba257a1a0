 In true British Airways style, President Cyril Ramaphosa was given an unofficial inauguration and welcome aboard a flight from Durban to Johannesburg earlier this week. British Airways, operated by Comair, honoured the President by sending first-time flyer and praise poet, Lutendo Evans Mugagadeli, known as 'Vendaboy Poet' to give him a warm welcome on board. Bridgette Ramuluvhana, Marketing Manager for British Airways, said, “Mr Mugagadeli recently said in an interview that he’d be honoured to meet the President and act as his official praise poet. We were delighted to make that happen and to ensure Mr Ramaphosa had a presidential welcome aboard. It exemplifies the British Airways brand promise, ‘To Fly. To serve.’”
