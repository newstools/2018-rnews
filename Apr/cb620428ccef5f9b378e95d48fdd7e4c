 Detectives at SAPS Kabega Park in Port Elizabeth are investigating a case of murder and inquest after the bodies of an elderly couple was found in their house in Sherwood, Port Elizabeth. "It alleged that on Monday, at about 07:00, a neighbour was driving out of the Everwood complex in Worthing Road, in Sherwood, when he noticed a note on the window of the house," said police spokesperson, Capt Sandra Janse Van Rensburg. "He stopped and the contents of the note read that whoever reads the note must contact the SAPS. "The person of the body corporate was notified and SAPS contacted." Capt Van Rensburg said that on entering the house, police found the body of a 64-year-old man hanging in the garage and his 67-year-old wife’s body lying in the back of his bakkie. "At this stage the cause and time of death of the woman is unknown and will only be determined once the post-mortem is held," she said. "Police found several notes at the scene. "The couple lived alone and their names are being withheld until their next of kin has been notified."
