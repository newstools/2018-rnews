 A 33-year-old man, Daniel Zambukeri, was handed a life sentence by the Limpopo High Court sitting in Thohoyandou for the murder of his brother's wife. "Zambukeri was found guilty for his starring role in the brutal murder of his elder brother's wife, Hlayisani Preshia Hlongwani (26)," said police spokesperson, Lieutenant Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe. "This heavy jail term emanated from an incident which took place on 17 April 2017 when the accused promised to accompany the deceased from Nsavulani village to Hlomela village where she was going to fetch her child. "He (the accused) organised the vehicle, but when they arrived at Hlomela village, the car drove straight into the nearby bushes. The deceased's legs were then tied against the tree and she was left alone. "In the evening, the accused returned to that spot, attacked the deceased and broke her arm, cut off her body parts before killing her." Lt Col Ngoepe said that following intensive investigations by local police, the accused was later arrested with three other suspects, who were released on R5 000 bail to allow for a separation of trial. "Nkhensani Christinah Mhlongo (52), Solomon Mngengeni Mahumani (53) and Amos Mafemani Chuma (45) are still expected to meet the same fate when they appear in the same court on 02 May," he added. The Provincial Commissioner, Lieutenant General Nneke Ledwaba, has welcomed this long jail term and also commended the Giyani Detectives on the job well done. “We hope that by removing this criminal from our streets for such a long time, will serve as a deterrent to all the criminals out there and our communities will also stay peacefully. All the criminals who are still engaged in any form of criminal activities especially crimes against women, will be dealt with mercilessly and without compromise,” concluded Lieutenant General Ledwaba.
