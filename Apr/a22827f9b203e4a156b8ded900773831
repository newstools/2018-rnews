 The case against controversial Nigerian Pastor and Senior Pastor of the Jesus Dominion Church JDI, Timothy Omotoso, again suffered a postponement in the Port Elizabeth Magistrate's Court on Wednesday. Omotoso, 59, briefly appeared in Port Elizabeth Magistrate's Court along with his co-accused, Zukiswa Sitho (28), Lusanda Solani (36), and Nobubele Mlindi (31). The case was postponed to the 15th of May at which his legal representative, Adv Peter Daubermann, accused the State Prosecutor, Zelda Swanepoel, of pulling delaying tactics. It was Swanepoel, who asked the Judge for a postponement as they are awaiting a decision by the National Director of Public Prosecutions (NDPP) on centralising the case. Omotoso was arrested by the Hawks on the 20th of April last year and has been languishing at the St Albans Prison ever since after his bail application was denied on two attempts last year. He faces multiple charges relating to sexual exploitation and human trafficking. He is alleged to have sexually abused several young women at his church in Umhlanga, Durban, under the pretext of healing them.. Sitho and Solani were arrested in November last year and for the sake of their new-born babies, they were released on R2 000 bail the same month. In March, Hawks spokesperson, Anelisa Feni, reported that a 31-year-old Mlindi had hnded herself over to the Hawks for the same allegations that Sitho and Solani face, which is “trafficking girls for Omotoso’s pleasure.” Mlindi was also granted R2 000 bail by the Magistrate's Court. It is alleged that between the years 2012-2016, Mlindi, who was working for the Department of Health in Port Elizabeth, recruited girls for Omotoso from around the country. It is further alleged that she, at certain periods, was the house mother at Omotoso's house. Mlindi now resides in Mmabatho, in the North West.
