 Gala Street residents in Ward 1, in Lingelihle, in the Inxuba Yethemba Local Municipality have reportedly been living in terrible conditions since 2014 with raw sewage flowing into their houses. "These residents are beneficiaries of a housing rectification project, but have been struggling with sewage since the completion of the project," said Cllr Bettie Lawens - Inxuba Yethemba Local Municipality. "We discovered that the sewerage pump is not working and is uncovered. This creates a dangerous situation as children can easily fall into the open pump. The door of the pump station is also not locked and there is no fence around it."  Lawens said that the effected houses are overflowing with sewage, which results in people getting sick in the area. "Many residents have made multiple visits to the local hospital and many have developed skin rashes caused by the unhygienic situation. The problem also has an impact on a crèche, caring for about 60 children, in Gala Street," he added. "This matter has been reported to the Chris Hani District Municipality (CHDM) since 2014. The CHDM is responsible for water and sanitation in Inxuba Yethemba and still nothing has been done." Lawens said that this is a clear indication that the African National Congress (ANC) government does not care about the health and safety of the people. "The Bill of Rights states that every South African has the right to a safe and healthy environment. The plight of the residents of Gala Street has fallen on deaf ears for years now - they have been robbed of their dignity. A letter (click here), detailing this dire situation and demanding urgent intervention, has been sent to Cllr Robbie Venske, who represents the DA in the CHDM Council. "Cllr Venske confirmed that he sent this letter on to the directors of technical services and health in the CHDM."
