 Indwe Risk Services on Tuesday, 27 March 2018, received three of the top five 2018 Santam National Broker of the Year Awards. The annual Santam National Broker of the Year Awards looks at the year-on-year performance and profitable growth of various insurance categories managed by insurance brokers across South Africa. Indwe Risk Services was recognised as: “To receive these awards from the leading short-term insurance group in South Africa and in competition with all of the leading insurance brokering firms is very special. It is a reflection of our ability to serve the interests of our clients best while ensuring that we also recognise the necessity to run high-quality and sustainable books of business for our insurance partners," said Peter Olyott, Indwe Risk Services CEO. "I am incredibly proud to have such a dedicated team who have worked so hard over the past few years to achieve this. These awards we received would not have been possible without each and every employee’s hard work, time and commitment to ensuring high-quality insurance solutions for our clients. Thank you Indwe for making this such an amazing team to be a part of and thank you Santam for your recognition.”
