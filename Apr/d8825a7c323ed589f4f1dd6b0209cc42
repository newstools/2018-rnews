 The Greytown Regional Court convicted and sentenced 34-year-old Bongani Mkhize to life imprisonment. "In August 2017, a 13-year-old girl was in the company of her younger brother when they were approached by their neighbour, who sent the younger brother to get money from his wife at Mhlangana area, Msinga," described police spokesperson, Col Thembeka Mbhele. "As soon as the brother left, the neighbour dragged the girl to the bushes, raped and threatened to kill her should she report the incident. "He then gave her cash to keep her quiet." Col Mbhele said that the mother noticed unusual behaviour by the victim and questioned her. "She then informed her mother of what happened and the matter was reported to the police." A case was opened at Msinga police station and transferred to Greytown Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit for investigation. "The accused was immediately arrested. He was successfully prosecuted and sentenced to undergo life imprisonment. His name will also be included in the Sexual Offenders list." KwaZulu-Natal Acting Provincial Commissioner, Major General Bheki Langa, said; “Sexual violation of minors and women in this province will be fought to bring justice to victims and ensure that perpetrators are kept behind bars indefinitely."
