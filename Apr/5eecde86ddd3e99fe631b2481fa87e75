 The national water storage in the country has improved, thanks to the recent rains that poured in some parts of the country, increasing from 77.6% last week to 80.6 this week. "All the provinces saw an improvement in water levels this week with the exception of Western Cape whose water levels are below 20%," said Departmental spokesperson, Sputnik Ratau. The provincial dam levels for this week have been recorded as follows: "On the other hand, the Western Cape continues to be in the midst of unprecedented severe strain. The drought stricken province continues to decline week on week from Voelvlei Dam, which supplies Cape Town and is at 13, 8%.  Theewaterskloof is at 10, 1%," Ratau said. "To augment the struggling West Coast areas, the Department will today release water from the Berg River Dam to Misverstand Dam. The Department had to take drastic steps as it was projected that this part of Western Cape is going to run out of water by 24 April 2018."
