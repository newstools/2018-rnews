 Western Cape MEC for Education, Debbie Schafer, on Wednesday expressed "shock and sadness" following a morning shooting incident at Middelpos Primary School, in Saldanha Bay. "I wish to express my shock and sadness at the fatal shooting of a teacher from Middelpos Primary School in Saldanha Bay this morning," she said. "The teacher was allegedly shot by a male perpetrator, who is reportedly her ex-spouse. The perpetrator is reported to have then turned the gun on himself. "Both succumbed to their wounds." Schafer said that learners, who witnessed the incident are greatly, and understandably traumatised, as are the teachers’ two children. "WCED officials, including Safe Schools officials, were immediately dispatched to the school. "The school has made the decision to dismiss learners early and a school psychologist and social worker will be dispatched to provide counselling for those who are in need of assistance, or witnessed the event," she added. "Educators from Middelpos Primary as well as the neighbouring school, Diazville Primary School are severely traumatised by the incident. Counselling and support will be provided." The SAPS was on the scene and the school and officials will co-operate with SAPS as required. "I am deeply disturbed by the unspeakably tragic incident. My heartfelt condolences go to the teacher’s family, friends and the school community."
