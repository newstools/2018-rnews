 Police in East London have arrested six people for public violence. "This follows a service delivery protest on R102 near Fort Jackson outside East London," said police spokesperson, Captain Mluleki Mbi. "The protesters had blockaded the road with burning tyres and other items. "Police dispersed the crowd by firing stun grenades and tear smoke." According to Capt Mbi, after dispersing, the protesters then proceeded to the ward councillor's house and allegedly stoned it and damaged windows.
