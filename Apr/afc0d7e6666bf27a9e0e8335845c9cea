 Newly-appointed Amatola Water CEO, Vuyo Zitumane, says that the water utility is delighted with the outcome in the legal case of its chairperson, Nokulunga Mnqeta. The case, which involved Mnqeta’s former role as CEO of the Amathole District Municipality’s Development Agency, Aspire, was concluded last week with all alleged fraud charges against her being dropped. She was arrested by members of the Hawks in May 2016 over allegations that she defrauded Aspire of R310 000 to pay for her private legal bills. The bill apparently related to misconduct charges brought against her by the then Aspire board. “We welcome this outcome, particularly as it comes at a time, when Amatola Water is doubling its efforts in rebuilding stakeholder trust and ensuring sound corporate governance is maintained,” explains Zitumane, whose appointment at the water utility became effective on 1 April 2018. “While the allegations vilified the chairperson in her personal capacity, they also had an impact in the reputation of Amatola Water.” “It is a comfort for both the chairperson and Amatola Water to know that the matter has been concluded and will not have any further bearing while we pursue our turnaround plan,” says Zitumane. Mnqeta, was appointed by the Minister of Water and Sanitation as the chairperson of the Amatola Water Board in February 2016.
