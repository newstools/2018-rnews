 Volkswagen Group South Africa (VWSA) employees and their loved ones joined hands on Saturday to uplift and renovate the Human Dignity Centre in Victoria Drive, Port Elizabeth. The Human Dignity Centre is a safe haven to orphans, vulnerable children and the people who care for them. The centre together with the Restoration Minisitries is run and coordinated by Jerusalem Ministries which has been running since 1995. VWSA employees teamed up with Rise Against Hunger which is an orgnisation that aims to end hunger by providing food and life-changing aid to the world's most vulnerable. Their goal is to create a global commitment to mobilize the necessary resources to end hunger. VWSA Employees assisted with packing 25 000 meals on Saturday.  These meals were distributed to the destitute that use the Human Dignity Centre as well as three other Early Childhood Development Centres in the Nelson Mandela Bay community. Additionally the volunteers painted exterior walls, water tanks and jungle gyms to brighten up the Centre.  A water wise garden was also planted. "I am so humbled by our employees giving their personal time to our Show of Hands initiative.  Being able to make a difference to this Centre means that these orphans and vulnerable children have a safe, bright and happy place to come to," said Nonkqubela Maliza, Director: Corporate and Government Affairs: Volkswagen Group South Africa. Over 160 VWSA Employees and their loved ones gave of their time and skills to upgrading the facilities at the Centre. The Volkswagen Show of Hands Volunteer Programme, which is an ongoing initiative under the Volkswagen for Good campaign, runs these volunteer projects. The Volkswagen for Good campaign focuses mainly on education and youth development. "I trust that in a small way, what we have done here today will change the direction of these children's lives," concluded Nonkqubela Maliza.
