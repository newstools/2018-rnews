 Thousands of commuters across the Nelson Mandela Bay and the country, who rely on bus services for their daily commute, will have to seek alternative means of transport after the public bus companies announced that they were suspending their services from Wednesday when a nationwide bus strike will begin. The strike comes after wage negotiations between unions and employer associations including Commuter Bus Employers Organisation and SA Bus Employers Association dealocked. The negotiations began in January. Five different unions, with members at 67 different bus companies, will reportedly participate in the strike. These include the South African Transport and Allied Workersâ€™ Union (SATAWU) and the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (NUMSA). The unions want a one-year 12% across the board wage increase, which includes a minimum wage of R8 000 according to a press release from SATAWU as well as full-pay for dual drivers, compensation for sleeping-out, and for any work between the hours of 8pm and 3am to be deemed the night shift. The employers are offering a 7% increase in year one. Algoa Bus Company advised commuters that its services have been suspended until further notice.
