 Millions of commuters nationwide on Monday faced an uncertain week as the bus strike that began last week Wednesday entered its second week. This is after wage negotiations between the workers unions and the employers again stalled on Friday. Different unions, with members at 67 different bus companies, are participating in the strike. The unions want a one-year 12% across the board wage increase, which includes a minimum wage of R8 000 according to a press release from SATAWU as well as full-pay for dual drivers, compensation for sleeping-out, and for any work between the hours of 8pm and 3am to be deemed the night shift. However, the employers are offering a 7% increase in year one, a 7.25% increase in year two and a 7.5% increase in year three. While the unions previously demanded a 12% wage increase, they have since come down to a 9% increase. They are, however, not willing to sign a multi-year agreement as offered by the employers. As of Monday, it remained unclear as to when the strike action will come to an end. THE FOLLOWING BUS COMPANIES ARE AFFECTED: Megabus; Gautrain Busses; Greyhound; Golden Arrow; My Citi in Cape Town; Rea Vaya in Johannesburg; Buscor in Mpumalanga; Bojanala in the North West; Algoa Bus in Port Elizabeth; Mayibuye in East London; Go George in George; Areyeng in Tshwane; Mgqibelo in Sedibeng; Lowveld Bus Company in Limpopo; PAL Bus in Mpumalanga; and Mphakathi in Mpumalanga amongst others.
