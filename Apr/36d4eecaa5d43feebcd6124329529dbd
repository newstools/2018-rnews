 The National Energy Regulator of South Africa (Nersa) will hold public hearings into Eskom’s Regulatory Clearing Account applications across the country, starting next week. “The Regulator will be holding public hearings in all nine provinces on Eskom’s Regulatory Clearing Account (RCA) applications for financial years 2014/15 to 2016/17 from 16 April to 11 May 2018,” said the regulator. Eskom’s applications total R66.6 billion. The regulator published Eskom’s third multi-year determination (MYPD3) Regulatory Clearing Account applications for year 2 (2014/15), year 3 (2015/16) and year 4 (2016/17). The public hearings will kick off at the  Cape Town ICC  in the Western Cape on Monday, followed by the Eastern Cape Training Centre (ETC) in Port Elizabeth on Wednesday. The public hearings will then move to KwaZulu-Natal’s International Convention Centre in Durban on Thursday followed by the North West’s Matlosana Civic Centre in Klerksdorp on 23 April. On 3 May, the public hearings will take place at the Mittah Seperepere Convention Centre in Kimberly in the Northern Cape. The public hearings then move to Protea Hotel in Bloemfontein in the Free State on 4 May, followed by the Orion Hotel in Nelspruit in Mpumalanga on 7 May. The Nersa hearings then move to Garden Court in Polokwane on 9 May, with the last public hearings to be held at Walter Sisulu Square in Soweto on 11 May. The RCA is a monitoring and tracking mechanism that compares certain uncontrollable costs and revenues assumed in the MYPD decision (made by Nersa) to actual costs and revenues incurred by Eskom. – SAnews.gov.za
