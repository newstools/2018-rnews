 The George Municipality has advised residents that traffic will be affected by a planned protest march by the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) on Thursday. According to the municipality, the march might cause delays for motorists between 10:00am and 12:00pm. "The march will depart behind the taxi rank in Mitchell Street at 10:00, proceed via Hibernia Street, crossing York Street into CJ Langenhoven Street, around the circle at the George Hospital from where the march will move to the parking area in front of the hospital via Davidson Road, where a memorandum will be handed over," described Debra Sauer, Communications Officer at the George Municipality. "The march will then continue along Davidson Road to the York Street circle, and down York Street to the parking area in front of the Civil Engineering Directorate (old Town Hall) to hand over another memorandum."
