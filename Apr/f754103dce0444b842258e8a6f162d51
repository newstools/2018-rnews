 An Independent Police Investigation Directorate (IPID) investigator appeared before the Nelspruit Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday last week for fraud. Jabu Elkum Ngwenyama is alleged to have defrauded the IPID by submitting fraudulent kilometres claims with regard to official trips undertaken. IPID lost over R20 000 from these apparent false claims made in 2014. Ngwenyama has been granted R3 000 bail and is expected to make a follow-up court appearance on 24 May. - SAnews.gov.za
