 The Joubertina Regional Court sentenced a 25-year-old man to 10 years behind bars for house robbery plus two years for burglary on Friday. According to a police spokesperson, Sergeant Majola Nkohli, Carools Tamboer was sentenced after he confessed during court proceedings because he could not dispute the evidence presented against him in the court of law. He said that Tamboer and his accomplice broke into a farmhouse near Heights area, in Joubertina, on the 25th of March 2018. "They assaulted a 74-year-old man with a snooker cue and stole a bag before fleeing the scene,” Sergeant Nkohli described. "Forensic evidence managed to link a suspect to the scene of the crime. The two sentences would run concurrently.” Humansdorp Acting Cluster Commander, Colonel Simon Swarts, said: "This sentence would go along way towards building safer communities. Police management would like to extend its gratitude to a team of detectives that finalised a case just over a week after the incident. "Currently, a team of detectives is working on bringing the second suspect before court."
