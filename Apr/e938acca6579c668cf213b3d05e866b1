 During a Crime Intelligence driven operation on Monday, the Port Elizabeth K9 unit and the Vehicle Crime Investigation Unit executed a search warrant at a business premises in Swartkops Street, North End, Port Elizabeth, for suspected stolen property. "Upon searching the premises police found various car parts such as turbos, diesel and injector pumps, throttles and various other engine parts," police said. "The property is valued at an estimated amount between R1.6 and R1.8 million. "The vehicle parts were positively identified as parts from VW and Ford and these parts were still in the original packaging." Police said that these parts can only be purchased from the dealers. "Upon enquiring from the owner of the shop about the possession of these parts, he provided a statement and receipts of the purchases made," police added. "At this stage no one was arrested, but an enquiry has been opened and will be investigated and sent to the National Prosecution Authority for further a decision."
