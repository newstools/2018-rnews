 Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality IDP and Public Participation meetings continued on Monday, with frank and robust discussions between the Municipality and the creative arts practitioners at the Woolboard Exchange Council Chambers in Military Road. Budget planning transparency and consistent consultation was the key issue that most of the speakers raised. They also called on the Municipality to prioritise creative arts in the same way that they do sport. The lack of adequate creative arts infrastructure was also a key issue raised.  Present at the meeting were Mayoral Committee Members for Budget and Treasury Councillor Retief Odendaal and Sport, Arts and Culture Siyasanga Sijadu, who was chairing the meeting. Councillor Sijadu said that the meeting was a first step in the right direction, where creative industry practitioners would be shaping their own destiny. "The platform that has been created, will definitely assist in improving the existing systems and make sure that the development of the industry is shaped by those who are part of it," said Councillor Sijadu. The meeting agreed that a follow-up session was necessary. Councillor Sijadu committed to convene the session soon so that more focused discussions could be held on resolutions.
