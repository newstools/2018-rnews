 The United Democratic Movement (UDM) on Wednesday said that it welcomes the continuation of the Special Council Meeting adjourned on 29 March following disruptions. On Tuesday, Acting Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality Executive Director: Corporate Services said that the meeting will be held on Tuesday. "I sincerely trust to the commitment of the Speaker in continuing this meeting well within the 14 day window resolved by council on 29 March," said the UDM Chief Whip, Councillor Thoko Tshangela. "I hope that the speaker will heed the advice of his party’s national leader, Mmusi Maimane, and provincial leader, Nqaba Bhanga, and of the multi-party caucus of whips and party leaders during a break in proceedings on 29 March, to proceed with the agenda without disruption and in the order of the motions submitted. "I am much impressed with the DA’s transparency in allowing a safe space for its councillors to vote their conscience." Tshangela said that the democratic example set in the Cape Town Metro Council on 15 February when DA councillors were allowed to vote without fear of reprisal is exactly what the UDM promoted in the Constitutional Court last year. "This sentiment had been echoed by Western Cape high court judge Robert Henney on 14 February." Tshangela said that Cape Town mayor, Patricia De Lille, said of Henney’s ruling, "I've created the space where (DA councillors) don't have to fear that there will be reprisals against them (for voting their conscience)." Chaos broke out at the Council Meeting held on 29 March after tensions rose before Councillors could even debate the future of Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality Executive Mayor, Athol Trollip.
