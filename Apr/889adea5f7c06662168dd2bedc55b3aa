 Two teenagers are expected in court soon after they were nabbed by Kabega Park police while committing a house burglary on Sunday. "On Sunday, at about 16:15, two juvenile suspects were arrested ‘in the act’ of committing a housebreaking at a house in Rowallan Park," described police spokesperson, Col Priscilla Naidu. "An alert neighbour notified police after noticing the two teenagers entering a yard in Christian Street Rowallan Park. Within minutes, the crime prevention members stopped at the given address." She said that a 15-year-old teenager was arrested in the house while the 16-year-old was arrested as he fled. "It is alleged that the suspects entered through the back door," said Col Naidu. "The suspects from the nearby Kuyga settlement are detained at Nerina House juvenile detention centre and are expected to appear in court soon." The Cluster Commander for Mount Road Cluster, Maj Gen Thembisile Patekile, extended his appreciation to the alert neighbour for  contacting the police immediately after the suspects entered the premises and for not ‘turning a blind eye’ to suspicious behaviour. "Homeowners are encouraged to inform their neighbours when leaving their houses so that they may keep an eye on the property. The community are the eyes and ears of the police," added Maj Gen Patekile.
