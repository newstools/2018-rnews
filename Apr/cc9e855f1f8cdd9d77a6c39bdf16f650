 Keeping the community safe requires vigilance and approaching each shift with the goal to go beyond the call of duty. This mantra of the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality Metro Police was personified with swift action at a vehicle check point in KwaNobuhle at 03:25am on Thursday morning. Metro Police Chief, Yolande Faro, said while her officials were busy checking vehicles way before the crack of dawn, they noticed suspicious-looking men walking in the vicinity of Bantom and Hini Street. “They stopped the suspects and deemed it necessary to search them. During this process a 9mm Norinco pistol fell out of the clothes of a 26-year-old man. “Who knows what plans these suspects had with this weapon and whether it was used previously in the commission of other crimes. “The man was arrested and taken to the KwaNobuhle Police Station where he was charged for the possession of an illegal firearm and ammunition. His 15 and 16 year-old accomplices were not charged,” Faro said. The South African Police Services (Saps) will submit the weapon for forensic testing as part of their investigation to determine whether it was used during the commission of other crimes. The man will appear in the Motherwell Magistrates Court on Monday, 23 April.
