 Transport Minister Blade Nzimande has appealed to all parties involved in the negotiations aimed at ending the bus strike, to urgently and cordially find a negotiated settlement. Minister Nzimande’s call follows organised labour in the bus industry having served a notice to strike on Wednesday. This following a deadlock with their employers after failing to reach an agreement in their wage negotiations on Tuesday. Minister Nzimande said parties involved must find a solution inspired by a common desire to make the bus industry a reliable, attractive and safe public transport mode. “The only reasonable outcome that government expects from the negotiations is the immediate resumption of bus operations, whilst labour and employers are finding a permanent solution to the impasse,” he said. While the Department of Transport is not party to the negotiations, Minister Nzimande is observing with keen interest on the negotiations aimed at ending this bus strike. The department will keep the public abreast of new developments as soon as they are available. – SAnews.gov.za
