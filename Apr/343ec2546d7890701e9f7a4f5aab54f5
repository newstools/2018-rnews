 Police in Port Elizabeth again made a dent in the proliferation of illegal drugs in the Nelson Mandela Bay area over the weekend. According to police spokesperson, Capt Sandra Janse van Rensburg, on Sunday, at about 13:20, members of Port Elizabeth Flying Squad were busy with routine patrols in Algoa Park when they received information regarding a vehicle possibly transporting drugs. "The information was immediately followed up and the white VW Polo was spotted in Whyteleaf Drive in Algoa Park," she described. "As the members attempted to stop the vehicle, the driver drove through a red traffic light while trying to evade arrest.  In so doing, he collided into another vehicle. "Members requested assistance from other police vehicles. The driver of the VW Polo continued bumping into other vehicles while escaping." In an attempt to stop him, a shot was fired at the tyre of the vehicle. "The driver lost control and collided into a traffic light," Capt van Rensburg said. "On searching the vehicle, 296 tik pipes, 66 mandrax tablets, 1 packet of tik and an undisclosed amount of money was seized.  The suspect was detained on charges of attempted murder, dealing in drugs and reckless and negligent driving. "The vehicle was also confiscated. The suspect will appear in court on Monday." The Cluster Commander for Mount Road, Maj Gen Thembisile Patekile, has commended the members of Port Elizabeth Flying Squad for their excellent arrest and immediate response to the information received. "Team work between the various units is crucial in combating and preventing crime in hot spot areas," added Maj Gen Patekile.
