 The Empangeni Regional Court convicted and on Wednesday sentenced a 40-year-old father to 20 years imprisonment for raping his daughter. "In November 2017, a 13-year-old girl was sleeping at her home in Nseleni Township when her father came to her room, forcefully took her to his room where he raped her. "She managed to run away and seek assistance from the neighbor," described police spokesperson, Col Thembeka Mbhele. "The matter was reported to the police and a case of rape was opened." Col Mbhele said that the Empangeni Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit investigated the case and arrested the accused the next day. He was taken to Empangeni Regional Court where he was prosecuted to serve 20 years imprisonment. In another case, another biological father (35) was sentenced by the Pinetown Regional Court for raping his then 14-year-old daughter. Col Mbhele said that in September 2015, the victim, her nine-year-old sister and their uncle were renting a house in KwaDabeka Township with their father. "The father forcefully raped his daughter in front of the younger daughter and threatened to kill her should she report what had happened. "The accused also chased his brother out of the house to prevent him from finding out about his horrendous deeds," she described. "The younger sister persuaded the victim to report the incident and they went to the neighbor who helped them to go to the police station." A case of rape was opened at KwaDabeka police station and transferred to Pinetown Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit for investigation. The father was arrested and sentenced to 18 years imprisonment. KwaZulu-Natal Provincial Commissioner, Major General Bheki Langa, condemned the actions of the accused, who were supposed to protect their children instead they abuse them in an unspeakable way. “I commend the investigating officers for ensuring that the accused are successfully prosecuted,” he said.
