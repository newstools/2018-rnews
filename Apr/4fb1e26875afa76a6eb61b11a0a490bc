 Two learners, aged 15 and 16 years old,  have been arrested and charged for possession of unlicenced firearm and unlawful possession of ammunition respectively in Port St Johns. "This follows after a teacher noticed something in a 15-year-old learner’s pocket and when the teacher requested that the item be handed over, he refused," said police spokesperson, Capt Nozuko Handile. "The learner was then taken to the principal where a 9mm magazine with 7 rounds of ammunition was handed over. He faces a charge of unlawful possession of ammunition." Further investigations implicated a 16-year-old whom police accompanied to his home where a 9mm pistol was handed over. Capt Handile said that they have both been charged for possession of an illegal firearm and handed over to their guardians, who had been warned for court. "Local social workers were also involved." She said that investigations will include the ownership of the weapon, how these learners acquired this firearm and whether it had been used in other crimes. "Parents and guardians are urged to become involved in their children’s activities, whereabouts as well as the company that they keep." Both learners have briefly appeared in the Port St Johns Magistrates Court on Tuesday accompanied by their guardians. They will reappear in the same court on the 4th May 2018 with their guardians.
