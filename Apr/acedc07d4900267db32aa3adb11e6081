 The Department of International Relations and Cooperation (DIRCO) confirmed that South African businessman, Justin Van Pletzen, is detained in Dubai. Van Pletzen went viral online after a video of him confronting Ajay Gupta in Dubai made rounds - apparently, he had made the confrontation as part of a R300 bet. In a statement on Wednesday, the department said it has received confirmation from the South African Consulate-General in Dubai that he has been detained. “It is alleged that Mr Van Pletzen’s arrest is linked to a video he recently circulated about Mr Ajay Gupta whom he met in Dubai. However, this is yet to be confirmed by the local authorities. “Consular staff from the mission in Dubai did visit Mr Van Pletzen today and DIRCO will maintain contact with Mr van Pletzen and his family to render consular services,” said the department. The department said it was unable to provide further details on the nature of the charges and on the date of Van Pletzen's court appearance. – SAnews.gov.za
