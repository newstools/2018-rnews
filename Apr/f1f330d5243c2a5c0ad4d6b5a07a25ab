 Police have confirmed that the body that was found at the Port Elizabeth harbour on Thursday by police divers is that of missing Gabon triathlete, David Rene Roger Bellet-Brissaud. Police spokesperson, Colonel Priscilla Naidu, said that Bellet-Brissaud's brother, who arrived in the country after the 48-year-old went missing, confirmed that it was indeed him. Bellet-Brissaud had last been seen ahead of the 2018 Standard Bank Africa Championship that was held over the weekend. According to police information, on Thursday, at about 15: 20, David Rene Roger Bellet-Brissaud and his wife booked into the Paxton hotel in Port Elizabeth. “He was in Port Elizabeth to participate in the Ironman Africa Championship,” said Col Naidu at the time. “After settling in, the couple took a walk on the beachfront and later dined with friends (other participants from Gabon) at the Boardwalk complex. “At about 21:00, they retired to their rooms.” It is further alleged that at about 01:00 on Friday morning, his wife woke up and noticed that her husband was not in the room and has been missing ever since. “CCTV footage shows that Bellet-Brissaud left the room and walked out the hotel and down the street. It is not clear in which direction he walked once on the main road. He did not take his wallet or cellphone with him. He was wearing a black hoody top with the words ‘Adidas’ on the sleeves, blue jeans and takkies,” Col Naidu said. His family on Monday made an appeal for his safe return and announced a R12 000 reward to anyone with information on his whereabouts.  The amount had since been raised to R150 000. It also emerged that CCTV footage had shown him at the harbour moving from one boat to the other before disappearing from view.
