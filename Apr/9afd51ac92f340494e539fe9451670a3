 The Centane Regional Magistrate Court on Monday sentenced a 29-year-old man to 12 years behind bars after it convicted him of raping a 16-year-old girl. It is alleged that Khotso Tshali came across the girl when she  was strolling with her boyfriend on the 15 November 2015 at about 20:30 at Nkente Location, Zibunu Village, in Centane. "He drew his knife and chased the boyfriend of the victim. The boyfriend ran for his dear life leaving the victim with the Khotso," described police spokesperson, Captain Jackson Manatha. "He then forced the girl to follow  him to his home where he raped her. "A rape case was registered at Centane Police Station." Capt Manatha said that the Butterworth Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit (FCS) joined forces to investigate the case. "The investigation lead to suspect being traced and arrested." Butterworth cluster commander Brigadier, Trevor Mey, welcomed the arrest and commended the  way the detectives handled the case. “It is always a joy to see a rape case resulting in a sentence because sexual offences in nature are unique cases that need more attention, diligence, time and concentration. When our detectives apply all of these qualities it usually leads to successful completion to any sexual offence investigation.”
