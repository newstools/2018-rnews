 The OR Tambo District Municipality on Wednesday said that it has opened yet another platform to engage with the taxi industry in its district. This follows the closure of some of the taxi ranks and routes out of Mthatha since 29 March after a spate of deadly shootings related to taxi violence. “The closure of such taxi ranks has not benefited anyone from our District. Commuters using those affected Taxi ranks have been the most affected. The economy of our District feels the punch," said OR Tambo District Municipality Executive Mayor, Nomakhosazana Meth. "Our people, including the taxi operators and owners are suffering too. "It is in the interest of all people to go back to normal operations, but must be done within the peace accord that all parties had agreed to which we believe will avert the taxi violence in our District." A meeting with stakeholders was held at the Savoy conference Centre, in Mthatha on Wednesday. According to the Municipality, the engagement with stakeholders aims at finding a long solution, which the District thinks can be ushered by the peace accord that all stakeholders participated in its drafting.
