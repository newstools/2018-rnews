 When will the enforcement provisions of the Protection of Personal Information Act (“POPI” or “POPIA”) come into effect? Latest indications are that the Information Regulator will announce final Regulations and a commencement date shortly, but there have been so many delays already that we perhaps shouldn’t be holding our breath on that one. To illustrate that risk – If you offer goods or services in or to the EU, you must, even if you are based here and not in Europe, comply by 25 May with the EU’s GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation). Take advice on the specifics – although it resembles POPI in many respects, there are key differences. Plus you risk severe penalties for contravention – fines up to €20 million or 4% of your annual worldwide turnover. -Credit:LawDotNews For professional legal advice, contact Goldberg & de Villiers Inc on 041 501 9800.
