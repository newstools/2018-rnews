"It is alleged that the suspect approached a group of boys, who were playing next to the road at Bhongweni locality and started stabbing and killing a seven-year-old boy," said police spokesperson, Captain Dineo Koena. "It is further alleged that the deceased's neighbour raised alarm to the community, who chased the suspect, who fled into a nearby forest and when seeing that he was cornered he fled to town, but was arrested by polic,e who were assisting the community before he could enter the town." She said that the deceased, who sustained upper body injuries, died instantly and the knife that was used during the commission of crime was confiscated. "This is a good message to all the communities that in joining hands in the fight against crime, all those behind terrorising our communities do not have space amongst us instead they belong to the dark cells. I thank all those that assisted us in arresting the suspect. Together we can do more," said Brigadier Nomawethu Makonza, in thanking Bhongweni community. The suspect will appear before Mthatha Magistrate's Court on Tuesday facing charges of murder.
