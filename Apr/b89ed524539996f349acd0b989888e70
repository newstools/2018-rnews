 The South African Weather Services' Port Elizabeth office on Thursday refuted a report by a local newspaper concerning warnings of heavy rain and disruptive snow as completely incorrect. "It must be one massive mistake or an OLD article, as I have not afforded an interview in this regards for ages," said Garth Sampson, Client Liaison Officer for the Eastern Cape at the South African Weather Services. "There are no warnings for heavy rain or disruptive snow over the weekend. Farmers do not need to panic and take precautions with small stock." He further said that no rain was measured over the Nelson Mandela Bay Metropolitan area. "A mere 0.2 mm was measured just before 8am this morning. "The report of between 64 and 39 mm is COMPLETELY incorrect," Sampson said. "In fact, we only measured 3.0 mm thus far for April (heading for the driest April on record), and  have ONLY had 76 mm this year thus far."
