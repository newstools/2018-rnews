 The relationship between the community and the SAPS will always be nurtured as valuable information is supplied on crime and criminal activities. "It is through the ongoing support and responsible reporting of these illicit activities that we can fight crime and rid the streets of drugs," explained police spokesperson, Captain Mali Govender. "Today, Thursday, members of the Port Alfred OCC followed up on information and arrested a 20-year-old male at Nemato for being in possession of crack cocaine valued at R1 600. "The suspect will appear in the Port Alfred Magistrate's Court shortly." She added that two suspects, a male aged 36 and a female aged 58, appeared briefly in the Cradock Magistrate's Court on Thursday on drug-related charges. "They were arrested in a joint operation on Wednesday by members of the Cradock K9, Route Patrol and POP unit," Capt Govender said. "Mandrax valued at R 3 798.00 and Swazi Dagga values at R8 080.00 was seized."
