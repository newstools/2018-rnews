 Butterworth police have opened an inquest docket following the deaths of three women, aged 21, 25 and 30 over the weekend. According to police spokesperson, Captain Jackson Manatha, it is alleged that the three died on Saturday, at about 04:30, at Mazotshweni Location, Tongwana Village, Butterworth. "A candle is suspected to have caused the fire, which led to the death of the three deceased," he described. "The deceased were having different surnames. It is not clear if they were related as they were sleeping in the same house." Captain Manatha said that Butterworth police are warning communities to be careful and always make sure they switch off candles when they go to sleep. "The identities of the deceased are still being withheld until all their relatives are officially informed of their death."
