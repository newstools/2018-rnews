 An 18-year-old male suspect is expected in court after he was arrested on Thursday, on a charge of house robbery committed in the Joubertina area. “It is alleged that a 20-year-old female was busy inside her home on Thursday, at about 09:00 in the Twee Riviere area, Joubertina, when the 18-year-old male forced his way into her home,” said police spokesperson, Captain Gerda Swart. “The suspect allegedly assaulted the 20-year-old female with a hammer and threatened her with a knife. “The suspect also demanded cash and took three cellphones, a DVD player and food from the home and fled on foot.” She said that the 20-year-old victim alerted the local community and a search for the suspect was immediately launched. Detectives from Joubertina SAPS, who was busy with investigations in the area, came across the community, who successfully apprehended the 18-year-old male suspect and he was handed over to the SAPS. “The suspect was searched and all the stolen items were found in his possession. He was arrested on the spot and is due to appear in the Joubertina Magistrate’s Court of Friday on a charge of house robbery.” The acting Cluster Commander for Humansdorp, Colonel Simon Swarts, expressed his gratitude towards the community for apprehending the culprit. He also praised the community and the detectives for working together towards building safer communities. The SAPS wants to encourage the community to work with the SAPS in reducing crime and they appeal to the community to provide valuable information that will lead to the arrest of those involved in crime. “Reject and report all stolen property to the SAPS,” Capt Swart said. “Let us share information and support each other in the fight against crime.
