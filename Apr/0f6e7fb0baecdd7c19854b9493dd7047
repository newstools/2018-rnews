 In the space of three months, the Port Elizabeth and Cape Town Magnetic Storm crew have been involved in a myriad of projects which have been months in the making. Bringing to life 13 high-profile events, including: the Coca Cola Annual General Managers Meeting in Mozambique, the DSRAC National Boxing Awards, the Egypt Cycle meeting (through Mirchee), the Miss SA Cape Town preliminary round (via Full Circle agency) and the Volkswagen South Africa Polo launch required meticulous planning of all resources. To do so, Magnetic Storm had to ensure its crew and technical skills were available at the right place at the right time. “Time and skills scheduling is made easier when you have a passionate crew, like we do, who love what they do, and are committed to doing it right, whatever it takes,” remarks David Limbert, Magnetic Storm’s head of creative services. In addition to an experienced team, a substantial amount of equipment was required to pull off the events across numerous venues. The infrastructure team was focused on an immense amount of stage design. “The majority of events required staging, and it resulted in our investment of additional equipment to fulfill all the projects,” adds Limbert. Whilst the busyness of major projects took place, it remained business as usual back at the PE and CT offices with various other projects, SLAs, installations and events happening. Having a permanent team of over 50 talented individuals, coupled with over 15 reliable freelance technical crew members and a large team of casual staff, is what makes all this possible.
