"On Wednesday, the Provincial OCC, with the assistance of Palmietfontein detectives, arrested a 32-year-old suspect at Kwa Guna administrative area in the Nketlana Location, a few kilometres from the Lesotho border," said police spokesperson, Col Priscilla Naidu. "Some of the property taken from the incident was also recovered." She said that the suspect will appear in the Hankey Magistrate's Court on Tuesday on four charges of attempted murder, rape, illegal possession of a firearm, robbery with aggravated circumstances, theft and indecent assault. "It is alleged that on 23 March, the 44-year-old victim and her children were attacked in their house by a gun wielding suspect. During the ordeal, the woman was shot and money was withdrawn from an ATM," Col Naidu said.
