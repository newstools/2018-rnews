 The Democratic Alliance has again called on Eastern Cape MEC for Transport, Weziwe Tikana, to urgently provide temporary office structures for Grahamstown’s traffic officers. "The Grahamstown Traffic Department office burned down on 30 September 2017 and traffic officers have been operating from a small storeroom, Department of Roads and Public Works offices as well as from the Department of Environmental Affairs office situated near the ramshackled traffic office," said Marshall von Buchenroder (MPL), DA Eastern Cape Shadow MEC for Transport.  He said that a parliamentary response from the MEC dated 13 March, states that the Department was in the process of finalising temporary office structures for traffic officers in Grahamstown. "Furthermore, the Department scheduled a meeting for 27 February 2018 in order to identify any further issues." Von Buchenroder said that on Monday, he conducted an oversight visit to the station to investigate whether any changes have been implemented "and to my surprise, I found that the traffic officers had been moved to a new store room in the Department of Roads and Public Works building". "No temporary office structures have been provided for the officers." He added that the traffic officers do not have laptops, internet connection or telephone lines in the temporary building that they are currently using and they have not been provided with secure storage cabinets where they can keep legal and confidential information such as summons. "The Department has had approximately six and a half months in total to provide interim infrastructure while waiting for the Department of Public Works to rebuild the Traffic Department office. Their delayed action in this regard is totally unacceptable," von Buchenroder said.
