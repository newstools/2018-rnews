 The continued seizure of drugs remains a priority for the South African Police Service and high density patrols proved successful on Tuesday when police officers clamped down on a large quantity of dagga. "Alert SAPS Kareedouw members noticed a person carrying a large bag suspiciously in Riebeeck Street, Kareedouw, at about 12:05, and they searched him," said police spokesperson, Capt Gerda Swart. "Members discovered dagga with a weight of 13.365kg and valued at R26 600-00 inside the bag. "The 33-year-old Joubertina male was arrested on a charge of illegal possession of dagga and he is due to appear in the Humansdorp Magistrates court on Wednesday on the charge." The acting Humansdorp Cluster Commander, Colonel Simon Swarts, commended the team for the arrest and confiscation of the dagga.
