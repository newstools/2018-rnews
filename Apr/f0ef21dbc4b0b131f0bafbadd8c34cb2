 The Coega Development Corporation (CDC) announced on Monday, it has been nominated for yet another international accolade at the African Infrastructure Project Developers Awards 2018 taking place on 18 June 2018 at the St Regis Hotel, Le Mourne in Mauritius, said Dr Ayanda Vilakazi, CDC unit head Marketing, Brand and Communications. No other SEZ in South Africa has previously made it on the shortlist of the prestigious awards. The nomination of the CDC sees it pitted against the best in both East, West & Southern Africa. The organisation has been shortlisted in the category for Regional Infrastructure Investment Initiative of the Year. “We are over the moon with the nomination as it boasts well for our African footprint development programmme. The CDC is in the process of intensifying its business outreach efforts by going beyond the borders of South Africa,” says Dr Vilakazi. The CDCs nomination is a second for the organisation in prestigious international awards after winning the Sub-Suharan Enterprise Awards - Best International Trade Marketing Specialist in Africa. Earlier this month, the CDC was one of only sixteen (16) finalist companies out of hundred and fifty eight (158) nominated for the Oliver Empowerment Awards. “Recognition by captains of industry demonstrates the extent to which we take our vision seriously, i.e. to be the leading catalyst for the championing of socio-economic growth, seriously when embarking on our work.” concludes Dr Vilakazi.
