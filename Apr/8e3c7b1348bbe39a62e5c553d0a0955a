 Magnetic Storm has been briefed by marketing agency, Mustard Seed, to present the Greenacres AW18 fashion show. Happening on April 28th from 11am to 1pm, the event will showcase the fashions available from retail stores at the popular Port Elizabeth mall. The first brief from Mustard Seed for Magnetic Storm, Greenacres is looking to reintroduce fashion shows to add vibrancy to the newly renovated mall and draw in new shoppers. “We’re using lighting design and intelligent lighting to create energy, and incorporating the natural light that infuses the space,” remarks Magnetic Storm Project manager, Niel Mouton. “We’re using colour to highlight the rich shades in the AW18 collections which are being showcased and using lighting to attract people to the fashion show and see what the retail stores of Greenacres has to offer.” The initial brief was to supply technical support for the event, but during the briefing sessions Magnetic Storm was able to inject some of its creativity and add value. “We have been afforded the opportunity to elevate the event and make it stand out and make an impact,” remarks Mouton. “We are providing staging, décor and have sourced the MC for the fashion show. Our 37 years of experience has allowed us to add production value and create an event that creates ‘talkability’ and encourages attendees to share their experience.”
