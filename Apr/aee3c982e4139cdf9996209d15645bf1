 The Willowvale Regional Magistrate's Court sentenced a 39-year-old man, Bhuntsulwana Maginindane, to undergo 25 years imprisonment for the rape of a 15-year-old girl. "The accused was sentenced on Wednesday at Willowvale Regional Magistrate's Court," said police spokesperson, Captain Jackson Manatha. "The accused went to the homestead of the victim on 15 July 2016, at about 01:00, at Khwanyana Location, Gosani Village, Willowvale. "He found the victim with her two sisters fast asleep. The other two girls managed to escape through the door and run for their dear lives. Unfortunately the victim was caught and she was severely assaulted by the accused." Captain Manatha said that the accused then raped her and he later left. "The victim managed to identify the accused as he is a local man." A case of rape was opened at Willowvale Police Station. "An investigator of Butterworth Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit (FCS) properly investigated the case," he added. "The accused was traced and arrested." Eastern Cape Police provincial commissioner, Lieutenant General Liziwe Ntshinga, has welcomed the sentence. She is of the view that the stiff sentence will send a very strong message to other would be rapists that Eastern Cape Police detectives will investigate all serious crimes and crimes against women and children to make sure that all the perpetrators are convicted and sentenced.
