 Three of the four suspects, who were arrested by police in connection with the robbery and abduction of an Addo farmer over the weekend, were charged and brought before the Kirkwood Magistrate's Court on Wednesday. "They are Bulelani Mti (26), Vuyele Malova (32) and Kwanele Madusi (27)," said police spokesperson, Captain Gerda Swart. "The fourth suspect, age 41, was released as he could not be linked to the case that is under investigation." She said that the three will remain in custody until Wednesday, 25 April, to allow for further investigation. The four were arrested on Monday night when a team of detectives searched the residential homes of the suspects in Addo.
