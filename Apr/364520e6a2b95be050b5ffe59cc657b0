 The Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality says it has taken measures to protect brands and sponsors at events from ambush marketers. A dictionary definition of ambush marketing is the practice by which a rival company attempts to associate its products with an event that already has official sponsors. "Ambush marketing can cost events companies, organisers and sponsors exorbitant amounts of money," said Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality Spokesperson, Media Management Officer Kupido Baron. "We are now in the process of having an Ambush Marketing Bylaw enacted for all events hosted in Nelson Mandela Bay, and need professionals in the industry and other stakeholders to give their input during a public participation session. "You have seen the newspaper advertisements and we would like to remind you to attend the most convenient session at the Port Elizabeth City Hall this week."
