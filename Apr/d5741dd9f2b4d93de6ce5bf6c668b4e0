 Convicted murderer and former Paralympian, Oscar Pistorius, finally reached a legal dead-end in his bid to have 13-year jail sentence for killing his girlfriend - Port Elizabeth-born model, Reeva Steenkamp, on Valentines Day in 2013, reduced. This is after the Constitutional Court dismissed his appeal to his 13-year sentence. According to an order from the Court dated 28 March, the application for condonation and appeal to leave were considered. However, the Court concluded that the application for condonation should be granted, but the application for leave to appeal should be dismissed, as it did not engage with the court’s jurisdiction. The Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) in Bloemfontein increased the former Paralympian’s sentence to 13 years and five months in prison for Reeva's murder. The Constitutional Court said that Pistorius should have been sentenced to 15 years, but the SCA took into account the time he had already served in prison. North Gauteng High Court Judge, Thokozile Masipa, initially sentenced Pistorius to five years for culpable homicide in 2014. He served only 10 months of this sentence before being placed under house arrest. The State later successfully appealed the culpable homicide conviction, and this was replaced with murder by SCA in 2016. Masipa handed down a six-year jail term for murder. The State then petitioned the SCA directly, with the argument that a six-year jail sentence was much too lenient. Pistorius' sentence was increased to 13 years in November last year. The papers for Pistorius’ final sentence were served on Monday. What is not clear is when he will be eligible for parole.
