 The former Chairperson of the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa), Rubben Mohlaloga, is expected to be sentenced on Tuesday in the Specialised Commercial Crimes Court in Pretoria. He was convicted of fraud and money laundering in January. Mohlaloga‚ along with five others‚ was accused of defrauding the Land Bank of about R6 million in 2008. Mohlaloga and his accomplices transferred money from the Land Bank to an attorney's trust account. Mohlaloga was appointed Chairperson of Icasa in December 2017. However, the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Communications recently decided to remove Mohlaloga as Icasa Board chairperson. The committee said the Icasa Act prohibits anyone convicted of fraud from serving as a councillor of the Communications Industry Regulator. The committee’s decision will have to be adopted by the National Assembly. - SAnews.gov.za
