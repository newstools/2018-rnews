 Port Elizabeth-based Unity in Africa Foundation, in collaboration with Propella Incubator, hosted the 2nd annual Legothon on the 27th and 28th of September, for young aspiring engineers to test their skills and compete with others to improve themselves. The Legothon may only be in its second year, but it has already become a key event in students’ lives. “Our core focus as a Foundation is to create employable engineers, through a programme called iGEMS (Incubating Great Engineering Minds) - a 4-phase education to employment initiative,” said Ryan Karshagen, Programme and General Coordinator at Unity in Africa Foundation. “We give youth the opportunity to enhance their education and transition through an internship year and onto tertiary education with guaranteed employment once they graduate,” said Karshagen.  The Lego robotics event forms part of the annual workshops that Unity in Africa Foundation host for their students. Six teams made up of four students, comprised of Grade 12 Phase, Learnership Phase and Tertiary Phase students through an all-nighter event. “The aspiring engineers are drawn from a pool of 40 schools across the metro, with it being a niche programme focused on personal development we only take 25 learners onto the programme every year,” explained Karshagen. Engineering company stakeholders and CEO's were among the judging panel to put the learners’ creations to the test.
