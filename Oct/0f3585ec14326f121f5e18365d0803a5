 Democratic Alliance (DA) Eastern Cape Premier Candidate, Nqaba Bhanga, says that the only way to bring dignity back to the people is by giving them jobs. Bhanga was speaking at Kwazakhele, a township in Port Elizabeth, where he grew up and attended school. As part of his campaign ahead of the upcoming 2019 Provincial and National elections, he has been conducting one on one interviews with the residents of the Eastern Cape about what they want the DA government to do for them in the event they get voted into power. Bhanga is the former Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality MMC of Human Settlements after the DA won the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality in the 2016 Local Government Elections, before being booted out in August this year. Nopinki Jukana, a Port Elizabeth resident, who was visited by Bhanga on Friday, said:" We face many problems at home m, firstly we don't have a water tap in our house, this house rains inside and we don't have an electricity box." Job creation the answer to many Eastern Cape challenges Although the residents were complaining about housing and other issues, Bhanga said the biggest challenge is unemployment. Bhanga said that if residents were employed, then their other challenges would be addressed. "The biggest challenge people face in the Eastern Cape is job scarcity and as the Premier candidate in the Eastern Cape I aim to create job opportunities," Bhanga said.
