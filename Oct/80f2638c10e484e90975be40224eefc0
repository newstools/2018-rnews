 There was drama during the second day of the trial of controversial Nigerian televangelist and Senior Pastor of the Jesus Dominion International church, Timothy 'Tim' Omotoso, on Tuesday after women claiming to be his security were manhandled and thrown out of the Port Elizabeth High Court. Apparently the two women, misrepresented themselves as Omotoso's security details when entering the courtroom that had filled to capacity. It is understood that the courtroom can only accommodate 50 individuals. When security told them that the courtroom was full, they apparently produced police badges and reported that they are Omotoso's security guards. However, police officers deployed at the court did not buy their story leading to a confrontation and the women being forced out of the courtroom. One of the ladies fought back, arguing that she has lawyers and that her rights were being abused.  Speaking for the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA), Tsepo Ndwalaza, confrimed that the women were indeed Jesus Dominion International church members. The church members say that Omotoso is innocent of the many charges brougth against him and his co-accused. Omotoso, Lusanda Solani and Zukiswa Sitho, are facing 97 charges in total, 63 of those charges constitute the main charge sheet while 34 are alternative charges. The charges include racketeering activities, sexual assault and rape. More to follow... Follow more RNEWS articles, subscribe to our YouTube channel and for breaking news LIKE us on Facebook.
