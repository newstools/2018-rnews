 A 29-year-old suspect is expected in the Port Elizabeth Magistrate's Court soon after he was arrested on Thursday by Port Elizabeth police after allegedly pointing a firearm at them along the N2 Highway. According to police information, authorities received complaints about a person placing big rocks on the N2, between Cotswold and Standford Road, in Port Elizabeth. Police Spokesperson, Captain Sandra Janse Van Rensburg, said that members of the PE Flying Squad and PE K9 Unit were dispatched. "It was suspected that people wanted to create an obstruction, forcing motorists to stop and then either hijack them or rob them of their personal belongings, adding that in the past, similar incidents were reported," she said. Capt van Rensburg added that on arrival, officers saw a man approaching them from the centre island of the freeway, armed with a firearm pointed directly at the members. Apparently, when the suspect noticed that it was a police vehicle, he threw down the firearm and fled. The police officers chased after him and managed to arrest him. However, upon inspection, they noticed that the gun was a plastic replica shotgun.
