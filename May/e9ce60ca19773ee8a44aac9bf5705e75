 The Coega Development Corporation (CDC), has been informed of its nomination as a finalist in the Infrastructure Development Award category in the Vision 2030 Awards taking place in Johannesburg on 21 June 2018. The CDC, which is the implementing agent of choice, has seen it flying the Eastern Cape flag high by scoring a fourth (4) prestigious award nomination in a short period of five (5) months, since the start of this year. “This nomination highlights Coega’s capability and an extensive experience as leaders in infrastructure development and facilities maintenance, which include localization, procurement and ICT expertise. "The organisation has project managed the implementation of a portfolio of national infrastructure programmes that is valued in excess of R10 billion since the inception of these programmes,” says Dr Ayanda Vilakazi, CDC‘s Head of Marketing, Brand and Communications. The Infrastructure Development Award category recognises those organisations that are involved in innovative, sustainable and efficiency-enhancing infrastructure development in South Africa. The scope of the award includes roads and railways, ports, energy, ICT, water and sanitation, housing, access to basic services, healthcare and education. “As previous winners at this national award in 2017, we certainly look forward to making it a double as we have set our standard very high during the year in project management and the implementation of infrastructure projects in South Africa,” concludes Dr Vilakazi.
