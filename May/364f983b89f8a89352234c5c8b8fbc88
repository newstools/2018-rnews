 International Relations and Cooperation Minister Lindiwe Sisulu has condemned the killing of Mangosuthu University Technology (MUT) student Zolile Khumalo, saying that South Africans are tired of such senseless killings and will not tolerate them. “We must do more to protect women from being murdered by partners or former partners. We trust that the judicial system will take necessary steps and send a clear message to perpetrators that South Africans are tired of such senseless killings and will not tolerate them,” Minister Sisulu said on Thursday. Minister Sisulu, who is also the chancellor of the university, sent her condolences to the MUT following the passing of Khumalo. According to reports, Khumalo was shot dead by her former partner on campus following what police are describing as a domestic quarrel at the student residence in Lonsdale in the Durban CBD. Khumalo, 21, was a first-year quantity surveying student while her former partner was an ex-student at the institution. Shortly after the shooting, the 23-year-old partner took to Facebook to apparently confess to the crime. He is now in custody until he appears in the Durban magistrate court on Friday on charges of murder, and possession of an unlicensed firearm and ammunition. Meanwhile, the sentencing of Sandile Mantsoe is expected to commence in the High Court in Johannesburg this morning. On Wednesday, Mantsoe was found guilty of murdering his then 24-year-old girlfriend Karabo Mokoena. He was also found guilty of assault and defeating the ends of justice for disposing of Mokoena’s body Mokoena’s charred remains were found in an open veld in the eastern suburb of Lyndhurst in April last year. - SAnews.gov.za
