 Police in Uitenhage on Friday warned residents of a new online rental scam that is currently being circulated on a well-known classifieds website. According to police information, there is advertising for a three-bedroom flat in Winterhoek Drive, Uitenhage, for the amount of R4 200-00 per month. "Several potential clients have fallen victim to this scam already in the last few days after they have deposited the R4 200-00 in a fraudulent account," described police spokepserson, Captain Gerda Swart. "Community members must think twice before making any payments. "Only pay when you have physically inspected and interacted with the landlord. Avoid any arrangement with a stranger that asks for up-front payment. "Never send money or give credit card or online account details to anyone you don’t know or trust. Never provide the information by email or a WhatsApp message." She said that the South African Police Service remains committed in creating a safe and secure environment for all people in South Africa, this can only be achieved if individuals and communities collaborate with the police by volunteering information on criminals and their activities.
