 A group of Fidelity and Metro security guards on Friday marched from the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium to the City Hall where they handed in a Memorandum of Demands. According to the Memorandum, on March 30th 2017, the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality promised to employ 845 insourced security officers to permanently work under the municipality starting form January 2018. However, out of that 845, only 460 were employed for a contract of three months, with the understanding that they will be offered permanent contracts afterwards. The three months passed, and they were asked to sign three-month contracts again. Apparently, when an adjustment budget was introduced by Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality Executive Mayor, Athol Trollip, there was a delay and the workers were told to wait until that is resolved. In their memorandum, they want to know when will the 460 workers be permanently employed; and they want the Mayor to say when the municipality will employ the remaining 385 security officers. View the memorandum here:   Selwyn Willis, Manager of Petitions from the Office of the Speaker, accepted the memorandum on behalf of the MMC for Transport, John Best. Speaking to RNEWS, one of the protesters, Siyabulela Mbanjwa, said that they are demanding answers from Best and the Mayor because they have been "playing duck and dive for too long." Willis said that he will make sure that Best gets the memorandum and responds within the given period of seven days.
