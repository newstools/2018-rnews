 A 27-year-old man is expected in court on Monday after he was arrested by police at the OR Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg carrying nearly R7 million in cash. The money, in American and South African currency, was seized by police and customs. "During a continuing and successful implementation of an integrated plan at the OR Tambo airport, the team, acting on intelligence, intercepted luggage suspected of containing undeclared cash," said police spokesperson, Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo. "After verifying that the bag did indeed contained an amount of US$199 300 and R4 500 400, which is a total value of R6 992 569.34, the suspect was arrested, preventing him from departing to Mauritious." She said that the South African Police Service, the South African Revenue Service, the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigations and port security continue to work tirelessly to ensure that crime, including the smuggling of illicit contraband and undeclared cargo, is not committed at our ports of entry. "The suspect is likely to face a charge of contravening the Customs and Excise Act and he is expected to appear in the Johannesburg Commercial Crimes Court on Monday."
