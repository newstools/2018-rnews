 Uitenhage police early on Friday morning a suspect for the possession of a suspected stolen motor vehicle even before the owner realised it had been stolen. "Due to the swift action by members of Uitenhage SAPS this morning, Friday, at 00:55, a red Nissan Sentra, worth R30 000 was recovered without the owner being aware that his motor vehicle was stolen," described police spokesperson, Captain Gerda Swart. "Members from SAPS Uitenhage were busy conducting high visibility patrols in the Fairbridge Heights residential area this morning, when they noticed, at about 00:55, a person driving suspiciously with a red Nissan Sentra in Lavender Crescent, Uitenhage. Police officials requested the driver to stop and they questioned him." The officers tested the vehicle for ownership and it did not match the explanation that the driver gave to the police. "Members went to the address of the rightful owner in Arum Street, Fairbridge Heights, which is very close to where the vehicle was found and woke the owner of the vehicle," added Captain Swart. "The owner was not aware that his vehicle was stolen and confirmed that the vehicle was supposed to be stationary in his yard. "Police officials arrested the 24-year-old male on the spot on a charge of theft of motor vehicle and he is due to appear in the Uitenhage Magistrate’s Court on Monday, on the charge." The head of Visible police at SAPS Uitenhage, Colonel André Swart, commended the members for the excellent work and said; “When operational duties are directed and coordinated, arrests are achieved to clamp down on property related crimes. “The main objective of the SAPS is to remain focused, visible and to act with the intent to clamp down on crime effectively."
