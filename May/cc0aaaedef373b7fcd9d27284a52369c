 It was all smiles and happiness as 54 staff members of Overstrand Municipality received their long service certificates from Executive Mayor Ald Dudley Coetzee at a recent council meeting held in Hermanus on Wednesday, 25 April 2018. Addressing the long serving employees, Mayor Coetzee said it is an honour to award certificates in recognition of no less than 820 yearsâ€™ combined service! He went on to say that this shows dedication and commitment to the Municipality and thanked the staff for their valued contribution. With an impressive 35 years of service, cashier Florence Ngwanya (Hermanus Administration) was the star of the long services awards. Unfortunately she was not available to attend the meeting in person due to work commitments.
