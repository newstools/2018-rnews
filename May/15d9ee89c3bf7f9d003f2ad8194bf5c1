 A 47-year-old man is expected in court soon after he was arrested by the SAPS Public Order Police Unit (POPS) at a violent protest in Colchester on Wednesday morning. According to police spokesperson,Â Andre Beetge, police were called out today at about 10:45 after a group of about 70 angry protestors blocked the N2 at Colchester "using a lamp post and stopping and using two trucks by force". "The police were just in time when arriving at about 11:00 when the two large trucks were found parked across both sides of the N2 and before the trucks were damaged by the group. "The POPS unit members dispersed the protestors into the area away from the N2 using teargas and stun grenades and arrested one male suspect," he described. "The N2 was opened shortly afterwards. No damages to vehicles were reported to police. The incident followed after the Metro were busy demolishing illegal structures in the area." He said that police are still maintaining a high visibility in the area to ensure the protestors do not approach and barricade the N2 or causing any form of damages to road users. "A case of damaging of infrastructure and public violence was opened and the 47-year-old suspect will appear before the Alexandria Magistrates Court after he is charged."
