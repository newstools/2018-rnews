 The urgent bail application of imprisoned African National Congress (ANC) Councillor, Andile Lungisa, will now be heard in the Port Elizabeth Magistrate's Court on Friday. Lungisa, who was last month convicted on a charge of assault with the intent to cause Grievous Bodily Harm (GBH), was sentenced to three years behind bars at the beginning of May. One year was suspended for five years, so he will serve an effective two-year jail term. Lungisa faced charges of assaulting Democratic Alliance (DA) councillor, Rano Kayser, and allegedly smashed a glass jug filled with water over Kayser’s head during a brawl that broke out a Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality council meeting in October 2016. His legal team indicated that they will be applying for leave to appeal the conviction and sentencing. Several African National Congress (ANC) supporters attended the court hearing on Thursday. Senior ANC official and fomer MEC, Mlibo Qoboshiyane, who also attended the hearing along with Lungisa's family, said that he believed Lungisa should not be behind bars. "There are no details for now to what is going to happen because the court has been occupied. Across the province, we have decided to come to offer our support because the young man doesn't deserve to be in jail," he said. "I think that the sooner he is afforded a chance as a law abiding citizen then we will come to court the next time he is invited." Family member, Ayongezwa Lungisa, said that the family only knows what the media already knows so they are also waiting like every one for more information on Lungisa's bail bid.
