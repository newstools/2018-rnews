"The operation focused specifically on the compliance of foreign-owned shops in the Missionvale area," said police spokesperson, Capt Sandra Janse Van Rensburg. "Four shops were visited and inspected by different units. "Police activity led to one suspect, aged 27, being arrested on charges of illegal possession of firearm and ammunition." Upon further investigation, it was confirmed that the firearm that was recovered was stolen during a robbery in New Brighton, Port Elizabeth, in 2005.
