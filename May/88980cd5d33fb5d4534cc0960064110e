 Controversial African National Congress (ANC) Councillor, Andile Lungisa, who was last month convicted on a charge of assault with the intent to cause Grievous Bodily Harm (GBH), was on Wednesday sentenced to three years behind bars. One year was suspended for five years, so he will serve an effective two-year jail term. His legal team has, however, indicated that they will be applying for leave to appeal the conviction and sentencing. Magistrate Morne Cannon said Lungisa had shown no remorse for his actions. --more to follow -- Lungisa faced charges of assaulting DA councillor, Rano Kayser, and allegedly smashed a glass jug filled with water over Kayser’s head during a brawl that broke out a Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality council meeting in October 2016. As a result of that brawl, DA Chief Whip, Werner Senekal, was also injured. Kayser had to be rushed to hospital bleeding from a huge gush on his head while Senekal was allegedly stabbed in the back with a sharp object by ANC Councillor, Gamilihleli Maqula. Reports suggested that trouble began when the ANC, which is now in opposition, objected to an item on the municipality's confidential green paper. In the ensuing chaos, glass water jugs were thrown at Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality Executive Mayor, Athol Trollip, the Speaker and Councillors. An ANC female Councillor collapsed in the mayhem and was also ferried to hospital. Port Elizabeth police had to be called in to restore order after a security guard fired two warning shots while trying to control the fighting Councillors. Kayser and Senekal later laid charges against Lungisa and Maqula. The ANC blamed the fiasco on the DA.
