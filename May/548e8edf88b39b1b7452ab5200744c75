 The Butterworth Regional Magistrate's Court on Thursday sentenced a 41-year-old man, Xola Guntu, to 15 years imprisonment after convicting him of the rape of a 14-year-old girl. "It is alleged that the accused was seen on 26 September 2014, at about 13:10, coming from a forest at Mission Village, Butterworth, with the 14-year-old girl," described police spokesperson, Captain Jackson Manatha. " The relative, who saw the accused with the 14-year-old victim became suspicious that the victim may have been raped at the forest. "The victim was taken to Tutuzela Care Centre at Butterworth whereÂ  she broke her silence and revealed that she was raped by Guntu." He said that the case was thoroughly and professionally investigated by the investigator of Butterworth Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit (FCS). "The accused was traced and later arrested." Butterworth Cluster Commander, Brigadier Trevor Mey, welcomed the sentence handed down to the accused person. He also congratulated the investigator of the case for his proper investigation of the case. "The sentence will send a strong message to those who continue to abuse women and children that our investigators will make sure that they are arrested and successfully prosecuted, said Brigadier Mey.
