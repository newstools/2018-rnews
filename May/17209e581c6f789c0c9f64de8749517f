 The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) in the Nelson Mandela Bay, who on Thursday announced the withdrawal of their motion to remove Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality Executive Mayor, Athol Trollip, will now table another motion at the end of the month. All motions against the Democratic Alliance (DA) led coalition were withdrawn after the opposition parties found themselves without enough numbers. In a statement, the EFF blamed Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality Speaker, Jonathan Lawack, for “being unable control and chair the council”. The party further said the “withdrawal” was actually a “calculated delay”. “On two conservative meetings, such motions have been denied to us through an adjournment. The last one being said to be adjourned permanently. A time limit that surely makes no sense even to the speaker who pronounced it,” the party said. “The DA opportunistically saw a gap in which to advance its own political agenda of keeping their mayor, and pronounced a date right after the sentencing of the ward 20 Councillor, Bongo Nombiba. “They also set a date that would be the day after Councillor Andile Lungisa’s sentencing, thereby knowing they are crippling the opposition.” The EFF says that according to rule 27.4 of the Rule of Order; Matters already discussed by the Council during the preceding four months may not be discussed under this rule. “We fully understand that this motion could not be debated when it has already been debated. As such, this is not a withdrawal, but a well calculated delay in the inevitable motion that will be tabled in the next council meeting of the 24th of May,” it explained. “We wish to reiterate we have pronounced on Trollip. Trollip is going.”
