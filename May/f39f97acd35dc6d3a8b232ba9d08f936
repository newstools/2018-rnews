 The situation has calmed down in New Brighton, Port Elizabeth, where residents took to the streets to voice their anger with their Ward Councillor on Monday morning and ended up burning an Algoa Bus to ashes. According to a police spokesperson, Captain Andre Beetge, the protest started early in the morning at around 05:00. He said that around 100 residents blocked Njoli Road in New Brighton, with buring tyres and rubble. “By 06:30, a bus was pelted with stones and damaged, and by 08:00, another bus was completely destroyed after it was set alight. Both incidents happened in Maqanda Street, New Brighton,” Captain Beetge described. “This followed after residents of Mandela Village voiced their dissatisfaction towards the local Ward 18 councillor in a housing-related project.” Attempts to speak to the councillor, Lungiswa Daphne Mnyimba, were unsuccessful. RNEWS was told that an Algoa Bus company media representative will only be available for comment on Tuesday. Captain Beetge said that the Public Order Police are still in the area clearing roads and ensuring the safety of community members.
