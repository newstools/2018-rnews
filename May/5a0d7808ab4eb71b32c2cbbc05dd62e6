 A 30-year-old Kwazakele man, Vusumzi Snyman, was on Wednesday sentenced to five life sentences plus 20 years for rapes committed over a three-year period by the Port Elizabeth High Court. "This followed after he was linked with DNA in seven rape cases - four in Kwazakele and three from New Brighton," described police spokesperson, Captain Andre Beetge. "His modus operandi was to kick open doors and raping and robbing his victims at knife point. "The court also handed him a further 53 years for the robberies." Captain Beetge said that his victims were between the ages of 21 and 60 years. Both the local Motherwell Cluster and Eastern Cape Provincial Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Units were investigating these seven cases and were present during the sentencing on Wednesday. The Motherwell Cluster Commander, Major General Dawie Rabie, applauded the two units for their excellent detective and investigation skills and added "suspects thinking of committing these offences will now be discouraged knowing that long prison sentences are given to rapists".
