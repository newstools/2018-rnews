 The 3.2 mm of rain measured during April in Port Elizabeth makes it the 2nd driest April on record, the South African Weather Service's Port Elizabeth office said on Wednesday. "Since 1937, only one April total was lower, in 1945 (73 years ago) when a mere 1.7 mm was measured," described Garth Sampson, Client Liaison Officer for the Eastern Cape at the South African Weather Service. "This is considerably below the average of 50 mm." Sampson said that the total rainfall of 76.2 mm, for the first 4 months of the year, is the 6th lowest since 1937. "This is 100  mm below the norm of 176 mm," he added. "The lowest occurred in 1953, when 53.4 mm was measured in the first 4 months. "The 9.4 mm measured in East London  during April was the 3rd lowest April on record." Sampson further said that in 1991 and 1994 a mere 7 mm was measured during April. "This is well below the norm of 77 mm. The first 4 months were not particularly dry, with good rains measured in March."
