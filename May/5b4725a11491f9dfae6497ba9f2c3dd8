 Former Nelson Mandela Bay Deputy Executive Mayor, Mongameli Bobani, who is also the Regional Chairperson of the United Democratic Movement (UDM), says he is in the process of suing Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality Executive Mayor, Athol Trollip; Democratic Alliance (DA) leader, Mmusi Maimane, and City Manager, Johann Mettler, for defamation. Speaking to RNEWS, Bobani said that the multi-million Rand defamation suit relates the tarnishing of his name and character after he was accused of siphoning monies through Milongani Eco-consulting when he was still Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality Mayoral Committee for Public Health. Bobani insists that no one has been able to prove his alleged involvement in any corruption at City Hall and while he has declared his innocence, his name was continually dragged through the mud. He says, as a result, he lost two jobs - his position as the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality MMC for Public Health and later, his position as Deputy Mayor. He adds that he now wants to clear his name by suing the DA leadership and the City Manager. Bobani says the allegations of corruption made against him by Trollip were extreme and serious accusations, which he has claimed the Mayor and forensic investigators have failed to prove. However, Bobani says he is also going after Maimane and Mettler. “I want to teach them a lesson that you don’t go around spreading lies about people without proof and without having the court finding them guilty,” he describes. Bobani adds that he also hopes to expose the DA as a corrupt party. Without delving into much detail about the lawsuit, he says that it could be launched in the courts this week.
