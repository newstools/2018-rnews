 Property-related crimes is one of the Mount Road police station's big concerns and Acting Station Commander, Col Kumla, commended officers for the arrest of one suspect after a break-in at a business in North End, Port Elizabeth. "The arrest was made after members responded to a complaint on Saturday evening, at around 18:00, of housebreaking at a meat market shop in Govan Mbeki Avenue, North End, in Port Elizabeth," police spokesperson, Capt Sandra Janse Van Rensburg. "Upon arrival, the business was searched but no one was found to be in the store. "The members continued the search in a court yard of the premises and found a 23-year-old suspect hiding." She added that police officers found him with meat valued at R9 000.00. "The owner of the business then identified the suspect as one of his employees, he forced a toilet window open and removed the burglar bars to gain entrance to the premises," she described. "The Detectives will also look if the suspect could be link to other cases in the area." The suspect will be charge with housebreaking and will appear in the Port Elizabeth Magistrate's Court on Tuesday.
