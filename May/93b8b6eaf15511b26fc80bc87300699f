 The Family Violence Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit (FCS) in Uitenhage secured another lengthy jail sentence for a convicted rapist. "Relentless efforts by members from the South African Police Service designated to the Uitenhage FCS Unit together with the criminal justice system, proved to be effective on Monday, when a perpetrator was sentenced effectively to 21-years imprisonment in the Grahamstown High Court on a charge of rape," described police spokesperson, Captain Gerda Swart. Fundile Sinuka, 32-years-old, was found guilty by the court for the rape of an 88-year-old victim. "The victim was raped by the 32-year-old accused on 28 April 2017, at about 15:30 in Addo," Capt Swart added. "Sinuka was apprehended on 30 April 2017." The acting Uitenhage Cluster Commander, Brigadier Ronald Koll, welcomed the sentence and commended the investigating officer for acquiring the effective sentencing. Brigadier Koll said: “We thank the justice system and the investigating officer for working together to ensure that the perpetrator was brought to book. The South African Police Service has a responsibility to protect the defenceless in society and we take these responsibilities very seriously through our thorough investigations. “We hope that sentences such as this will send a strong message to any potential rapist and we trust that the lengthy sentence will serve as a warning to criminals preying on our women and children who are not in a position to defend themselves."
