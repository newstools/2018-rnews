"High density patrols on the national roads proved successful on Monday, at 16:00, when SAPS officials clamped down on the illegal possession of 29 mandrax tablets," said police spokesperson, Capt Gerda Swart. "Alert SAPS Uitenhage members on patrol noticed a person hiking with a bag, behaving very  suspiciously and after questioning him they searched him. "Members discovered 29 mandrax tablets  with a street value of R1 740.00 and R1 410.00 cash inside the bag." The 26-year-old Klipplaat man was arrested on the spot and detained on a charge of illegal possession of mandrax and he is due to appear in the Uitenhage Magistrate's Court on Wednesday on the charge. The Acting Station Commander of Uitenhage, Colonel André Swart, commended the members for the arrest and confiscation of the mandrax and cash.
