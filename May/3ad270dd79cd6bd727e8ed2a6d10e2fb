 Police are still on the scene of a shooting incident that happened at the main taxi rank in the Port Elizabeth CBD on Friday morning, apparently following a heated argument. According to police information, the 40-year-old victim was shot in the head at point blank range and died on the scene. Details remain sketchy as to what exactly happened with bystanders not wanting to speak to the media. Police spokesperson, Captain Johan Reeder, said that the police are still uninformed about what exactly led to the argument and how it led to the shooting. "A taxi marshal and a taxi owner were reported to have been seen arguing and one of them was shot in the left of his head and died at the scene," Captain Reeder said. He said that more details will follow once the police have all the details.
