 Oyster Bay households will have the opportunity to register for free basic services from Kouga Municipality next week. The municipal team will be stationed at the Oyster Bay creche from 7 to 10 May to register those households that qualify for free basic services (Equitable Shares). Registration will be openÂ from 8.30am to 3pm. Free basic services are available to all households with a combined monthly income of about R3400 (twice the state pension). According to Finance Portfolio Councillor Brenton Williams, those who are registered, receive 50kwh electricity plus the basic charge for free, 12kl water plus the basic charge for free, free refuse removal and free sewerage (based on 12kl water consumption). They also do not pay the Environmental Management Fee (EMF) levy and rates for an additional R85 000 on their properties. The drive will conclude at Jeffreys Bay from 14 May to 7 June. Residents are advised to watch the press, municipal website and Facebook page for further details. Williams reminded applicants that they are required to complete the application form personally. The following documents must also be supplied: municipal account and prepaid meter number, ID document (husband and wife), proof of income (bank statement, pay slip or pension card), sworn affidavit if unemployed, proof of usufruct (if owner is deceased, a letter of authority and death certificate).
