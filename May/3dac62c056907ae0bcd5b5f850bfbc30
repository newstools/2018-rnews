 The Democratic Alliance (DA) in the Eastern Cape on Wednesday condemned the latest wave of protest action that is sweeping the Eastern Cape "in the strongest terms". "This lawlessness cannot be allowed to take a grip on our province. Otherwise, is has the potential to plunge us into outright anarchy," said Bobby Stevenson (MPL), DA Eastern Cape Shadow MEC for Safety and Security. "Last night, the Great Kei municipal building and vehicles were set alight in Komga as part of suspected protest action. Last month, violent protest action took place in Keiskammahoek and in Grahamstown, where the hostility escalated to shops being looted. "In March, a 62-year-old man was shot dead in Keiskammahoek during a protest." Stevenson said that people taking the law into their hands and damaging municipal property needs to be met with the full force of the law. "The DA calls on the South African Police Service (SAPS) to take speedy action to arrest these culprits so an example can be made. "When the Soccer World Cup was held in South Africa in 2010, there was zero tolerance against lawlessness and criminal behaviour.  The culprits were brought speedily to book," he said. "The DA calls for the same spirit and the same type of response in our province today. All voters are sick and tired of these criminal acts. "What we need is a change in approach to dealing with this lawlessness that protects life and property. A new DA-government will ensure it happens."
