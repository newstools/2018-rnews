 Ricochet Publishing launched their latest franchise on Thursday, 10 May, Home food and Travel Gauteng South and West. Graeme Lund, Managing Director of Ricochet Publishing, says, “Gauteng South and West is our eleventh Home Food and Travel franchise.  We have another two franchises being launched in June, both for the Cape Town area.” Home Food and Travel is perhaps one of the most enjoyable franchises to own as the franchisee gets to visit and enjoy the game reserves, hotels, restaurants, spas and events in the area while earning an income from these activities. “We designed this franchise for people who want to own a business that can be run from home with minimal overheads and have plenty of fun doing so,” adds Graeme. Ricochet Publishing also has franchises for Wedding and Function and Kids Connection
