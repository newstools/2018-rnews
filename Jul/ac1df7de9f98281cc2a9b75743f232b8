 If you also thought water is expensive in the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality due to the ongoing drought, then buckle up because water is going to be more expensive according to Executive Mayor Athol Trollip while addressing a press conference held on Wednesday to give updates about the water situation in the Bay. Trollip revealed that the Metro is experiencing one of the worst droughts in decades and with the scarcity of rainfall, the combined level of the five major dams that supply the Metro as well as the Kouga Local Municipality, have dropped to just 21%. He advised residents of the Metro to now cut down on their water use to 40 litres of water instead of 50 litres. Trollip said that there will be consequences for people, who use water carelessly, but those who have been saving water must continue to do so. “The target is to save 250 mega litres a day and the minimum is to reach the target but it the decrease of 42 mega litres from September last year to May 2018 is very commendable.” Trollip said that he recently had a meeting with Councillors of the Sarah Baartman District Municipality - the Metro's dams are located in that district, and they came to a conclusion that both municipalities are facing a water crisis, which needs to be dealt with immediately. “Aspen has already complained about how expensive water is in this Metro and water is about to become more expensive especially to businesses like Aspen, who consume a lot of water. “Let us change the way we consume our water,” he described. The good news is that there will be no Day Zero on the horizon for the Metro like there was for Cape Town. “We took an informed decision and said that this city will not run out of water by redirecting money and it will not because this city has a water augmentation and water supply resource like few other Metros,” Trollip said.
