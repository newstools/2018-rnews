 Grahamstown was awash with excitement and festivities this past weekend, as arts and culture enthusiasts flocked to the city, for the 44th National Arts Festival (NAF). The chatter at the festival this year focused much on the newly situated Village Green. Festival goers and Market stall owners alike, agreed that the Village Green, now situated at the Victoria Girls High School sports grounds, gave the National Arts Festival, market section the facelift it needed. The green was alive and bustling, compared to previous years, where Stallholders complained that they made very little sales and that many visitors did not frequent the area, largely because it was situated to far from the city centre. This year, however, was a totally different scenario- with a lively food court area, a beer tent with outside seating and loungers, and pretty bunting flags hung up between the tents, revellers happily gathered and congregated at the green. On Sunday afternoon, NAF visitors filled the market and soaked up the sun, enjoying the food and drinks on offer at the various food stalls. Families enjoyed the live outdoor entertainment of street theatre, acrobats and buskers performing in the green. NAF Village Green assistant, Joselyn Olkers said “This year the village green is much better, because it is centrally located, close to the High Street and the layout is cosy and well designed”. A stallholder, who didn’t want to be named said “It is too early to tell if the new location and layout of the village green and market stalls will improve sales for the stallholders, but it is definitely jollier in the green this year”. Grahamstown Art teacher, Madelize van Der Merwe, commented “I Really like the beer tent this year, there are comfortable sofas and lots of seating, it’s a good place to unwind and relax with your friends after you have seen a show”.
