 Many people where heart broken when the old Algoa Bay Yacht Club closed. The Chartroom Restaurant within the clubhouse and the bar and deck where favourites with many local diners. The delightful view of the harbour, the great food and the large bar and semi enclosed deck ensured that this restaurant was extremely popular. The good news is that a new restaurant will be opening in the same location on the 1 September. Ruben Rosales from Finecorp Trading, the company behind the project, is over-seeing the opening of the new restaurant, bar and conference centre. Ruben says, “We are very excited about this project and are making improvements to the landscape and bar and adding some new safety features. Our planned menu includes seafood and grill as well as tapas and Sushi bar” The building and the grounds are currently receiving a face lift and the kitchen is being upgraded. It is anticipated that the new restaurant will be able to seat at around 200 guests. This number can be increased on special occasions where the ground-floor bar and entertainment area may also be utilised. Rubens adds, “We know how popular the old restaurant was and so we plan to ensure that the new restaurant is just as enjoyable. The bar will have big screen TV’s for sport fans and we plan to have live entertainment of special days.”
